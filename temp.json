The area resembles the old shopping strip-meets-new shopping strip of San Luis Obispo.  What they did -- or so I've been told -- is that they've managed to preserve the old strip, leaving it looking the way it presumably did in the 70s.  Rhino Records is located in the older part.  The Back Abbey in the new part.  Both distinct areas of their aesthetic and consumer pull. \n\nThe Back Abbey specializes in Belgian draft beer.  They carry some German and English beer, as well.\n\nWow, the selection of beer. Let me tell you! A lof of them I have never heard of. I tasted the Augustijn (Belgian) and the Hofbrau Original (German).  Both were good, but I prefer the Hofbrau.They come in different sized glasses, with the Hofbrau coming in a long glass. The Augustijn was $9, and the Hofbrau $6. The Hofbrau came in the larger glass, so the Augustijn must be considered some premium brew for it to be in a smaller glass and come knocking down doors at a mighty $9.  \n\nI liked the overall aesthetics of the place. There is an up-close-and-personal feel to the bar. Along with the standard bar and barstools set-up, there's a long table that goes from one end of the bar to the other. People sit across from each other and, since the tables are not wide, you're not far at all from the person sitting in front of you. Like I wrote earlier, up close and personal is what this bar has going for it.\n\nThey have a food menu, as well. Above their draft selection of beer, they have a chalkboard placed high up with a list of what they serve. For those veggies among us, they even make a veggie burger.\n\nLastly, the patrons all seem to know each other. Maybe it's the small town mentality. But it's not exactly a backwards, hick town. It's very much modern in certain ways, and people just love to talk. Couple that with brew, and there's a lot of talk going on.\n\nI had a discussion with someone at the bar, who bartends at a bar not too far from The Back Abbey, and he told me that the Augustijn is the oldest beer recipe known to man. (Ah, ok. Old is vintage. Vintage is expensive. Thus, Augustijn is expensive.  And two + two = four. I got this down, partna'.)   Again, can we give it up for \"up close and personal\"?\n\nAnd, lastly, the bartenders were very attentive and enjoyed talking about the difference between the brews. The goateed gentlemen was specifically patient in describing which ones were Belgian, German, and English.\n\nThe mantra of this review should be \"up close and personal.\"  This is what this 4-star bar is all about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "81IjU5L-t-QQwsE38C63hQ"}

Thai Singha House does indeed have a section of their menu that reads vegetarian, but, unfortunately, their definition of vegetarian is different from mine.\n\nAll of the vegetarian curries, I was fortunately informed upon asking, do indeed contain fish sauce, which is an ingredient in the curry itself, and cannot be omitted.\n\nMy server suggested the pad thai as a fish-free vegetarian alternative, which I ordered, holding the egg. When it arrived, there appeared to be tofu in there and no egg, which was a good sign. But after a few blind, trusting bites I quickly realized that there was also chicken or pork mixed in as well. My server graciously took it back and honored my request for a house salad, of which I wasn't charged.\n\nI don't blame Thai Singha House for not understanding the definition of vegetarian (sadly, I know a few \"vegetarians\" who just don't eat red meat) although there are non-vegetarian Thai restaurants that get it and get it right, like Tamarind on South Street. \n\nSo, it's up to us as consumers to ask questions beforehand if we're not totally sure. And this is probably wise at any place where there is an ethnic and language barrier (On a related note, don't be fooled into thinking you can get vegan pho in Philly. It does not exist. You're eating beef broth or non-pho water broth, but not pho made with vegetable stock.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hnz1_h_D1eHSRtQqHSCZkw"}

I got a plate, and I was very pleased with the amount of meat I got.  However, what's the deal with only one pita?  I ran out of pita before I was halfway done with the lamb.  For something that costs so much less than the meat, why not toss another pita on there?  Pita was fine, very average.\n\nFor sides, I got the fries and the green beans (which come in a tomato sauce).  The green beans were too salty, and the fries not enough.  Fries were nice and crispy, but almost no flavor.  Beans were so-so, tasted like they were probably canned, but not bad.\n\nThis place is a good value, so definitely wins points there - plate was just over $7 with tax, and a good amount of food, plus a beverage.  I'm sure this is mostly because it is one of the newest places in PC, but the line was significantly longer/slower than the other places, which makes it tough on your lunch break, so keep in mind if time is an issue.\n\nOverall, two thumbs up on the meat (+2 stars), and a good value (+1 star), which makes it above average for PC offerings, but that standard is already low, unfortunately.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BKI9lC-Mn2W7TtjEInsaLA"}

I loved the service, everyone was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive. \n\nSo if you're looking for something different, a little off the beaten path of traditional Brazilian restaurants and you like  to have cheese with your wine before your meal like I do, then I would check this place out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ"}

I wouldn't say it was particularly good - it was exactly something I could have whipped up at home. My real gripe is that the guy didn't ask me if I wanted my toast buttered. I expected just some toasted bread that I would put jam on or something. But, out comes two slices of overly buttered toast; it was practically a butter sandwich.\n\nI guess that's my real problem with the place. It's set up like a diner but it doesn't have the diner atmosphere. A diner is supposed to be friendly and chatty but the employees didn't talk when I entered, ordered, or waited. It's also supposed to be bustling but the place, which is pretty small to start with, was practically empty at lunch hour. It was a diner without the appeal of one.

My eventual overall dissatisfaction arose from multiple cases of what started off as relatively minor problems.\n\nIn each case, what I thought of as relatively minor problems, grew into unresolvable beasts, when I had a need to contact CUSTOMER SERVICE (and I use that term very loosely). I don't know that they still do so, but I learned to cringe when they answered the phone with, \"How may I provide you with excellent service?\". It got to the point that my standard opening response was, \"I'll accept decent service\". \n\nWithout going further into details, I haven't had business with them for over 3 years now, that said... they have come back, uninvited, into my life.\n\nMy credit monitoring service recently contacted me with a notice of unusual activity. Investigating, I discovered that a collection company out of Florida had placed an unpaid bill of $33 on my credit report. There were no details but digging deeper, I went to http://annualcreditreport.com/ and found that it was associated with an AT&T claim.\n\nAs much as I dislike AT&T, I ALWAYS pay my bills (assuming I'm aware of them). I'm still investigating, but, this is just another check box confirming to NEVER again consider purchasing ANY service from AT&T.\n\nTheir sales people will say all the right things. Their brochures are shiny and refined. Their commercials are alluring. Their actual services and products are.... okay... but when something goes awry, and sooner or later something will... their customer service is substandard, significantly so, and is the basis for AVOIDING this company at all cost.

I'm not a fan of cream cheese appetizers so this was good, but not my favorite.  I did like the heat of the jalapenos though.  SHI-SO HOT; tempura fried shisho leaf topped with spicy tuna and a drizzling of eel sauce.  This was GREAT.  I was slightly disappointed that the shiso didn't add much flavor but the crisp worked wonderfully in holding up the tuna, which matched very well with the sweet sauce.  GYOZAS are great - handmade with a light loose veggie filling.  \n\nBoyfriend ordered the HAMBURG steak, three thin patties of ground beef with a pan fried crisp bottom and slathered with a homemade ketchup.  It comes with a side of cabbage slaw, potato salad and a wedge of cantaloupe.  Boyfriend liked the potato salad, which had cucumber slices inside. \n\nI ordered the MATSURI CHIRASHI, which came loaded with julienned daikon, furikaka sprinkled over the rice, and a selection of fishes - 3 tuna, 2 tamago, 1 salmon, a pile of ikura,  clam, eel, mackerel and I forget the rest.  \n\nFriend ordered the SPICY TUNA SALAD, which he enjoyed.  \n\nThe cooked entrees are all very reasonably priced at under $15 .

Nevertheless I will provide information on that.\n\nI learned about Dr. Tobinick via a Youtube video his office uploaded.  I made an appointment for a free consultation; his office is in the UCLA medical plaza  They had me first watch a video detailing his unique procedure which, he claims, will eliminate pain associated with a herniated disc (in about 70% of patients).\n\nI have a herniated disc in my neck.  The pain is much less than it was a year ago, but still I have pain every day and so I'd like to have my condition corrected.  I only take Aleve or aspirin on \"bad days.\"  I didn't see Dr. Tobinick but rather one of his associate MD's - Dr. Reyzin.  The staff said Dr. Tobinick was in Florida.\n\nAnyway, Dr. Reyzin said I was a candidate for this procedure.  The next step would be to schedule a complete examination and physical test - cost $300.00.  The procedure then costs $3,000.00 - $5,000.00.  That's a lot for a 10 minute procedure but if it works it would be worth it.  I have health insurance and I'll have to see if they'll cover this.\n\nI came home and tried to find some negative (or positive) info about Dr. Tobinick on the web; I couldn't find much of either.  I'll keep searching.  I'll update this review if I decide to have this procedure done.  My gut feeling tells me something is not right with regard to Dr. Tobinick's claims.  If 70% of patients had their pain eliminated, wouldn't every spine doctor be performing this procedure?  Or perhaps, maybe the procedure works but after several months to a year, the pain comes back (which is typically what happens when steroids are injected into a herniated disc).", "type": "review", "business_id": "FXpHCkccct8SJjN9r1BvPw"}

I don't know why, but people really make a big deal about this place. Best Thai food in Seattle? Maybe if all the more spacious and comfortable ones in the area are somehow inferior. That's not to say this place is anything short of excellent, or that I doubt in its ability to stand up to the competition. The food here is simply outstanding. Whether it's a better Thai restaurant than all the other ones in town is another question, but what is certain is that you really can't go wrong with any money spent here.\n\nBecause I knew how popular this place is and how limited the seating would be, I anticipated it getting full shortly after opening. I stood outside and waited until 11:30 AM with a handful of other eager customers. By 11:35, nearly every seat was taken. It was then that I realized I was dealing with serious business. While I was lucky enough to be seated, I saw the waiter turn away a few people and ask them to come back later because there just wasn't enough space to accomodate them. I don't know whether to be impressed by that, but if they're so successful, I wonder why they can't afford to get a bigger place.\n\nThe place itself, if the other reviews haven't made it obvious by now, is constantly busy and crowded. It looks old, worn out, and generally unpleasant. But it's a restaurant and not a museum where you marvel at artwork. The air here is pretty much always thick with the smell of delicious fried food. The kitchen isn't in its own separate room way in the back and out of the public eye; the cooks make your food right in front of your eyes. Consequently, it can also get rather hot, especially if you sit by the fires. But all this food is definitely worth the trouble. No matter how long you have to wait, you can be entertained by the aroma of other customers' meals and the display of the food being made.\n\nSince so much of the fun of eating here comes from watching the cooks make everything, I'd suggest getting one of the seats at the counter near the front of the restaurant, kind of in the corner. It's a spectacular display, although not as ostentatious as teppanyaki. The cooks' hands move with astounding speed. They'll grab from the ingredients around them, crack eggs single-handedly, and noisily clatter the woks around as they perform all their cooking in a seemingly effortless manner. It's nice being able to see exactly how all this food is prepared, especially if it's obvious that it's being done by people who clearly have a lot of experience.\n\nThe menu here is something of an oddity. Instead of the usual thin and light paper menus, the ones here appear to be entirely painted on wooden planks. My first instinct was actually to take it as a joke, but I realize that it may have been a stylistic choice. I suppose they're really going for that authentic Thai feel here. From the rather brief list of hardly more than thirty items, I ordered the Phad Thai for $7.50. This restaurant is supposedly top-tier, but I wanted to get the most basic dish before venturing onward to their more \"specialized\" delicacies. I got it with chicken and three stars on the spicy scale from one to five.\n\nAlthough there was quite a long queue of customers who had already placed their orders before I could get a chance to, it's almost not a concern because it was such a delight watching the guy cooking the meals jump from making one person's dish to another. It's amazing how he never seemed to mess up, too. On numerous occasions, it looked like he was stirring the food too carelessly and would make a mess, but he always seemed to catch it in his wok. The show had an almost mesmerizing quality to it. I don't know why I get such a kick out of watching one person multitask so efficiently. It's an entirely missed opportunity if you get seated at one of the tables to the side, away from where all the action is taking place. For this reason, I would not recommend coming here with too large and cumbersome of a group. Either way, it's quite possible to get seated right next to a complete stranger here.\n\nMy much-awaited lunch arrived with the chicken Phad Thai on one side of a long bowl, a clump of white rice occupying the other side, and a wedge of lime adjacent to all this. Sizzling in front of me, it looked and smelled like quite a feast, although I couldn't help but notice that it was... disappointingly small. To be fair, it was a very inexpensive dish, but insufficient as a whole meal for a voracious eater like me. All petty complaints, because the food itself was without a doubt among the best of Thai cuisine I've ever experienced. A sweet taste was dominant with this Phad Thai; I guess they had skimped on the spiciness, but I won't hold it against them. I may have exaggerated the flaws, but they're all insignificant when you consider that this is just about as close to perfection for Thai food in Seattle to feasibly reach.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw"}

I'm a huge fan of The Back Abbey's burgers, but the service and wait are always brutal, so I was really hoping that Eureka would win me over.\n\nAfter finishing my dry, medium-well (I asked for medium-rare) \"Italian Caprese Burger\" that was heavy on the bun and light on the flavor, I decided that The Back Abbey is definitely worth the longer wait AND the more expensive check. I would only return to Eureka if The Back Abbey had an hour+ wait, or if I just wanted a beer sans burger (the bar seemed pretty chill).\n\nSo why did I give Eureka 3 stars instead of 2 or 1? The service was great. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and she gave me an awesome beer recommendation (I had a \"White Rascal,\" which tasted like a more delicious Hoegaarden). She also hooked us up with the delicious truffle sauce stuff for our fries that came with the burgers for only $2 instead of making us order the $7.50 \"Eureka Truffle Fries\" appetizer. The restaurant has several big-screen TVs, which is much better than The Back Abbey's one small TV at the bar if you want to watch a game. They also had some pleasant, mellow live music. The burgers were roughly $9-10, which is about $2-3 less than the burgers at The Back Abbey, and they came with fries, whereas The Back Abbey's burgers do not. My beer was $5, which is way cheaper than the average beer at The Back Abbey (this price difference is not surprising though since \"White Rascal\" is from an American brewery).\n\nBasically, I was hoping that Eureka would be The Back Abbey plus a hostess and a larger waitstaff, but their burgers just weren't up to snuff. I would potentially go back to enjoy a \"White Rascal\" on their awesome outdoor patio, but when it comes to burgers, I'm still Team Back Abbey all the way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TFxcmjVIsW5bdW7rilHHpQ"}

I normally like a strong garlic taste, however the garlic on the bruschette was more of a mild nutty garlic flavor but still so tasty! The tomato&basil bruschette was typical and nothing too special. The caprese salad was also very good, had fresh mozzarella and pesto.  Then we got our scallops and cauliflower, and I know everyone raves about the scallop, but the scallops were just good, not extraordinary. On the other hand, the cauliflower was AMAZING! I don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but if everyone made cauliflower like this, kids wouldn't have any problems eating their veggies! We got our bacaro burgers, with the egg of course, and it was a unique way to eat a burger, but unique in a good way. By the end of all our small plates, we were incredibly stuffed.

I'm a regular here, and for a good reason. Many good reasons actually. \n\nOne of its best qualities is how late they serve food until - Midnight every night. And their late night menu is not your usual bar fare. Everything from great munchies in the appetizer section to full salads, burgers, and veggie lasagna. Of course you can also score the Fries for the Boys, Nachos, Quesadilla, et al.\n\nThey have live music Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Sometimes Sunday and Monday too. My favorite nights are Thursday for the great jazz bands and Sundays when they feature a solo pianist. Food in front, beer in hand... Nothin' better.\n\nThe food is amazing - gourmet quality and an excellent selection. Especially for someone who leans toward vegetarian, but they don't discriminate. Some of my favorites include:\n-The Breakfast Burrito, a more-than-hearty package of potato, eggs, and cheese. Comes with salsa. Perfect for a Saturday morning with a Bloody Mary, or any other time of any other day (it's on the late night menu!). I usually add avocado. Classic.\n-The Dijon Chicken, creamy, savory completely satisfying. Sub the chicken for tofu if that's your thing.\n-The Veggie Burger. Or the Eggplant Burger. Or any burger really. So good. \n-The Taco Salad. It's hearty, it's pretty healthy, and it's so so good.\n-The desserts! Bread Pudding, Vegan Chocolate Cake, Mocha Torte especially. Ask for some of Dr. Bob's ice cream on the side! Expletive, that is incredible.\n\nDrink selection is pretty killer too. They have monthly special martinis, but I usually go for their great beer selection.\n-Dale Bros beer! Not only is it local to Upland, but the beer is so good! I've made many converts to their brews, from the classic Pomona Queen to their special brews like the incredible California Black Beer.\n-Chimay White, and cheaper than it is at The Back Abbey a few blocks down.\n-Wine Wednesday. Speaks for itself.\n\nObviously I love the place, and am friendly with much of the staff. But I'm trying to write an honest, helpful review. I hope that comes across.\n\nI'm sad to see that some people have had some bad experiences, especially Mister X (I don't totally agree with all of Molly Z's review, if they run out of stuff it's because they purchase local, they're not a \"wine restaurant\" they are a restaurant, they don't have tablecloths at the bar tables, etc. - none of that is unreasonable). There's no denying that they had some bad experiences though.\n\nAnd that's a shame. The place is a rare combo of excellent food, drink, and culture. I hope those reviewers can take some solace in that the restaurant takes those critiques and any other comments they get very seriously, and work to improve the place and their service, as any good restaurant should. So some good comes out of that. Shame it had to go down this way.\n\nIt's worth seeing for your self. It really is.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ekd4p4JmygAgzoaR4jFMJQ"}

As upset as I was, I was also thrilled that it would finally be open. Except that Monday, when I drove over, it was closed again. WTF?!?\n\nThey finally opened on Wednesday, so Ben and I made plans to have lunch there on Friday. My enthusiasm was dampened a bit by Jenny's review, but I saw on Chowhound that you could get kimchi if you asked and that the spicy chicken was pretty tasty.\n\nBen ordered the bulgogi and I ordered the spicy chicken. You get to pick two panchan dishes; we both got the spicy cucumbers but I ordered the sesame broccoli and Ben ordered the Asian potato salad. I liked the spicy cucumbers more than he did, but then again, my mom doesn't make these for me on request. The potato salad had onions in it, so I didn't try it, but Ben said it was just okay. The sesame broccoli was extremely bland and the stalks were somehow...flaccid. Ugh.\n\nThe spicy chicken was decent, though not that spicy; the flavor profile was pretty good but it just needed a little extra oomph. The bulgogi was underspiced and a little fatty. Oh, we did get kimchi, though ODDLY ENOUGH, they asked Ben if he wanted it and not me. I was insulted; I could be Asian, too! I have totally passed for Filipina before. Anyhow, I ran back to the cashier and asked to have some added to my order. It was not bad, though a little extra-fermenty to my tastebuds. Ben said it tasted like it came from a jar.\n\nOn the bright side, the place is really nicely decorated and they serve Diet Coke.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EAYBdA_ZWXcHmH9rYtIdHg"}

With such a grand sign in those great two colors, I had to give it a try before I completely moved out of town. When a 4-star average on Yelp, I had pretty high expectations going in.\n\nUnfortunately, these expectations were not met, and my overall dining experience was mediocre. I got a Georgia Reuben, a sandwich I have enjoyed many times from Zingerman's and Dimo's.\n\nFor the same price, at Dimo's I can get a sandwich that's twice as big and frankly twice as good. I wonder if the high average of M&B is due to the fact many of the students reviewing it have never ventured out to Stadium. I'm amazed by how many people here are raving about the size of the sandwiches...I peaked at the couple next to me and there's were also the same size as mine...while they pack in a decent amount of meat, I wasn't even completely full and needed to grab a slice of pizza a few hours later. Dimo's has never failed to completely fill me up (you get chips in addition to a pickle there). Zingerman's Georgia Reuben or Tom's New Job, while far more expensive so perhaps not a fair comparison, are still far superior sandwichs.\n\nUltimately a lot of this comes down to ingredients. Both Dimo's and Zingerman's use their own bread...while Dimo's bread isn't world-renowned like Zingerman's, its still huge and guaranteed always since they make it themselves. M&B's bread was mediocre bread-aisle bread. Meh. For a Georgia Reuben, having crisp bread is key.\n\nI didn't feel the other ingredients blended that well together. While the turkey wasn't by any means bad, it lacked its own taste...it just felt bland. The cheese wasn't well melted and the Russian dressing sauce was lacking. It mainly felt like I was using bread to eat a lot of turkey with my hands. For the price I paid, I was expecting a more holistic sandwich experience.\n\nThe place itself is nice enough; its small, with the menu taking up an entire wall and a TV in the corner. Props to them for offering so many types of sandwiches. The service was fine--they bring the sandwich to you which is a nice touch.\n\nI would appreciate it if the sandwiches were larger, ingredients (esp bread) were better, sandwiches were warmed/cooked more, and came with chips. That's a lot to ask for. Would I return? Probably not. There are too many other great options on South U to pass up, and if I want a sandwich, I'll head over to Dimo's or Zingerman's.\n\nGo blue though!", "type": "review", "business_id": "GqqBWV8ysYB48_jLPMl2bA"}

Of course I said that's fine. I mean, I always put my hair up and on her card it said master stylist....hmmm. \n\nAnyway, she washed my hair and did some trimming. While she is cutting my hair she tell me about this procedure that would make my hair straight and really awesome, how much you say? $$450 bucks$$ How long does it last? 2-3 months!! \n\nWhen she finished doing her thing, she started to blow dry my hair, and then told me that she could do it half way or all the way dry, but my hair would be fluffy. OF COURSE...you guessed it! I opted for half way. She dried it for what seemed like than 5 min. At my other place it takes at least 2 people 7-10minutes to completely dry my hair, that's the magnitude of fierceness people! I digress... \n\nShe put some spray of product in my hair and showed me the mirror. It looked like my hair was more pufffy and frizzy than when I came in. She told me I shouldn't put my hair in a ponytail..Ok you're the master lady. She gave me her card and a print out of the expensive ass procedure she mentioned. I paid and tipped her and was on my way. I know I should have said something. But I'd expect them to know hair more than I would. \n\nThe worst part was walking to baby Gap which is almost next door to the salon. I caught a glimpse of my hair in the mirror, and I looked like some kinda crazy! I could not put my hair back up in a ponytail any faster!!! I tell you guys, NO STYLISTS SHOULD HAVE LET THEIR CLIENT WALK OUT OF THEIR CHAIR LIKE THAT! If you want proof or a laugh just ask me for the pic I took not 5 minutes later at Gap. I'll gladly provide it to you. HORRIBLE. I wanted to cry. TEARS!! \n\nSeems like a very big hit or miss here from the reviews I read. However, I will not be back...ever!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2MJzSgwVK_IgqJ9y3XpaKQ"}

Eh, that doesn't always work out well... The place had much recommendation, therefore I had the thought to order something basic to size up the place.  Since this was mainly a steakhouse, I decided to go with the steak and fries dinner - too boring for my usual fare.\n\nThough boring sounding, that was only until the food arrived.  The steak came out amazing, and the fries that came in a metal cup (and stayed hot throughout) were some of the best I've ever had.  The meal was full of flavor and the taste seemed to linger on for days.  The lady also raved about her delicious looking perfect seared scallops and asparagus dish.\n\nWe topped it off with an equally delicious bananas foster, another boring sounding dessert done right (while enviously watching the two businessmen eat their cool looking sorbets).\n\nComing back shortly after for lunch with our out of town guests, I sprung for the 21 day dry aged Delmonico steak ($37).  Seasoned and salted perfectly, this must have been the best steak I had in the last few years.  Tasting their Filet Mignon side by side, this fattier special cut was a couple more times more flavorful.\n\nTry the steak.

It was a pumpkin soup with pumpkin seeds on top and pumpkin crispy things.  While good, not worth $10.  The dish was very shallow, and I really don't think any soup is worth $10.  My mom had the salmon with couscous which was around $16.  She thought it was good, but lacking in flavor.\nThe problem I had with Upstairs, besides being overpriced, was I felt I didn't belong.  It was a Monday afternoon, but I felt under dressed (it was cold, I had a puffy vest on ok), and out of place.  The guys sitting directly behind me were obvious intellectuals who have to talk just loud enough so everyone can hear their conversation and know how smart they are.  Also, someone, who I believe to be the manager/owner was walking around to several tables talking to them about their meals (which I find a bit odd for lunch?) and completely skipped over our table, even after catching my eye.

I ordered the D5 beef, the lowest tier of beef on the menu. The thinking was as a direct comparison to Shabu-Zen - their lowest-quality beef is quite good. Shabu Square's beef offering was $1 cheaper, but for the quality, it should have been a bit less. A very unappealing cut of meat, chewy when cooked, and with little flavor. \nThe noodles were fatter than I've had elsewhere, which was a plus, and the vegetable plate was quite nice, missing only some tofu options.\nThe dessert was a thai custard, which was served with two pieces of white bread. Wonder Bread, rather. A very unappealing presentation, but the custard was quite delicious.\n\nThe service, Im happy to say, was excellent - I never felt like people were hovering over, waiting to refill my water every time I took a sip, and I also was never put out for want of service. \n\nIn all, I think you'd do better with the higher-end offerings. The service was quite good, but the decor was a bit off (posters of alaskan tundra and caribbean beaches? errrrrr...). \n\nIn all, decent if you're craving shabu, but don't skimp on what you order.

I came here with my friend Sam N. and my other friend Patrick M. I ordered Shumai, which did not come until 1.5 hours later - with no apology, no nothing. An hour and a half later... FOR SHUMAI. This was supposed to be an appetizer! This was supposed to come out before my sushi! I was sad and hungry. Also, Sam N.'s Baked Lobster was cold in the middle and her portions were so small.  Our waitress, never checked in on us (which is also why my appetizer took too long) and we were sitting right behind the hostess' table. -_-' Not to mention, it took forever to get our check and leave. My best friend is a sushi waitress and I can understand the restaurant is busy, but it doesn't excuse the lack of amiability or attention to our table.\n\nThis is really not okay. \nThe reason why I gave Yamato's 1 star instead of 0 was because of Jesse, my last waiter, who really made an awesome impression on our table and gave us the extra attention I never see at this restaurant. I sincerely wish that service was replicated at every single order of Yamato.\n\nDaryl W. has made an awesome point: word of mouth is a powerful tool and I have already seen Jill T.'s review on facebook with MY fraternity brothers and my friends talking about it. \n\nPeace out, Yamato.\nAfter the piss poor service and mediocre sushi, I'm out of here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eqFRLwj2_0v_1y2y8Ur3cg"}

My fiance was OK with that, since they needed to be done soon or later. It wasn't any problem until we got the truck back. It stalled 3 times in the middle of W Holcombe (before the Kirby intersection). It was an EXTREMELY scary situation because this could have caused an accident as other cars will run into his truck. Luckily speaking, he was able to pull over to a strip center immediately. We were able to drive back to the shop, and when we confronted the manager, he was like there should be NO PROBLEM!!! He let his mechanics (whoever worked on the truck) to look into it again. We waited for another 30 minutes, and according to the manager's explanation, he said that it was NO PROBLEM at all because they tested drive it again and it never stalled. Plus he believed that the computer in the truck was set in the re-training mode (WTF, they must have done something, hello, although my fiance and I were no mechanics, but we aren't stupid). Wasn't it their job in the first place to ensure that everything was fine before letting us picking the truck up??????? Without a doubt, all they care about was the MONEY, and they didn't give a crap about our safety. FYI, this was our first visit, and it will be our last as well.

I start going back up to them, and before I even open my mouth, the waitress glares at me and spits out, \"No.\" Shocked, I ask, \"excuse me?\" and she replies impatiently, \"You're not getting a discount.\" I was indignant; I have never received such disrespectful service before in my life. I tell her reasonably that under normal circumstances, restaurants would provide free compensation just for any sort of foreign object, and that all I was asking for was a 30% discount. The waitress insisted that I do not deserve any sort of discount because \"It was not a fly, it was just a little bug.\" \n\nI ask to speak to the manager, the girl says that the manager would not come out to see me, and that I could take a 10% discount or that she would call the police. Two minutes later, she changes her story and tells me that the manager is not there. Seeing that I was getting nowhere, I take the 10% discount and tell my friends that we are not paying any tip.\n\nWe get our checks and see that they've charged us an 18% gratuity for \"parties of 5 and up.\"\n\nSave yourselves the frustration and do not go to this restaurant.

As somebody who has lived in Japan for some time I like that the variety of authentic Japanese teas and specific food items.  On the other hand most of their sushi menu obviously caters to the local crowd of people who think that Ann Arbor is part of the civilized world.  Bland and boring to say the least, but the commoners will probably like it (if you've ever ordered a California Roll then I'm talking to you).  I personally don't get sushi here, I come for the freshly made ichigo daifuku (a dessert of rice paste enclosing a glob of sweet bean paste and a strawberry); they're orgasmic.  They best I ever had were in Hokkaido, but the ones here are easily comparable to those I could get in Tokyo or Boston.  \n\nThe people here are really great (friendly, helpful, informed, etc.) and most (perhaps all) of the staff speak Japanese which is nice for me too.  The decor is strange.  Most of it is very starched and plain -- uncomfortably white and hospital-like.  But then it is combined with an authentic Japanese garden fountain and the bamboo highlighted booth-like seats and such.  I've been there for lunch a few times and it was okay, I really recommend it for tea and daifuku.  \n\nI also really appreciate them being open until 8:00PM on Christmas Eve, everything else was closed at 6:00 and I wanted to get some work done in a cafe like I always do.

Its a classy joint with an eclectic crowd ranging from local college professors, students, blacks, whites and the occasional bro entourage wandering in from Rancho/Upland (and their numbers are definitely increasing, I'm guessing a few of the negative reviewers may be of this persuasion).\n\nI should say also though I've frequented the Press with regularity now for a few years, its always been a night spot. For the majority of its patrons, the Press is a bar that happens to serve food. \n\nFor this reason I suppose I can't say much to the negative reviews about the service. I just have never gone in there wanting or expecting a welcome wagon when I walk in the door nor a big corporate lapdog of a server. The Press is old school, the servers allow you the space to enjoy your meal and company without rushing. \n\nI will agree with those who have complained about the door, as they have had some atrociously dim and rude doormen in the past. Whatever, isn't that what a doorman is, a professional douche?\n\nNow on to the food and drink. Like most Claremont stops neither are what you would call cheap, though if you are more of a beer or wine person you don't have to spend much (especially on 1/2 priced wine bottle wedensdays). They always have a Dale Brothers or two tap which is great and a respectable though pretty standard selection otherwise. The food is good, with the majority of the choices being lite and fresh. I just had the Mahi Mahi tacos last night and they were great albeit admittedly a little dry, but the salsa took care of that.\n\nIt also hosts live music many nights out of the week, in my opinion its biggest weakness, as the majority of the local acts are pretty bad. \n\nUntil the emergence of the Hip-Kitty, the Abbey, and some of the newer places in Pomona, The Press really was an oasis amidst the dessert in terms of its uniqueness in the bar scene. So to all of you complaining about the \"pseudo-intellectual\" crowd (because it makes sense to call grad students psuedo intellectual), you know the High-Brow is just up the street and they're probably wandering where you are.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ekd4p4JmygAgzoaR4jFMJQ"}

After we had sat down they waited 20 minutes before they even took our drink order.\n\nWe asked an employee about speeding up ordering and dinner and he said he would get someone. A waiter walked over and asked us if we needed a table ( even though we literally just stood up from one 10 feet away from him). We told him we asked to speak to a manager and he said \"oh just bothering the sushi chef huh? Great\" \n\nWe proceeded to walk out. All 15 of us and not one person tried to stop us or ask what was going on. Needless to say I will never go there again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "w-bOlmwKOqPKwq1t5zuuwQ"}

I think the advantage of this store is that it's really really close to UCLA. I heard about this place pretty much through word of mouths I feel like I had to try this place. Don't hate me but I feel like this place is overrated. The cookies sure are cheap, you can walk in here with $5 and get out of the store with a dozen of cookie and maybe one ice cream sandwich but the cookies were wayyy to sweet. Probably perfect with a cup of milk but enjoying it alone made me feel parched. The ice cream are Dryer's not homemade, not exactly what I expected but won't complain because I do like Dryer's. If you have a sweet tooth I guess this place really is for you. Their cookies have loads of chunky chocolate and nuts on them. You'll get your money's worth but as far as the taste goes, I really think it's overly sweet.\n\nService was kinda meh.. but it was probably an off night.", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}

Yes, it was that great!  From start to finish...service, to food, even price point...I can't imagine it getting any better than this!\n\n   My sister had found a deal for Il Palio of 3 courses including a bottle of wine for $59.99 per COUPLE.  Their regular price for their 3-course menu is $39.99 per person with no wine.  So, quite a deal!  We made reservations and showed up tonight (Saturday night) for our 6:30 reservations to a relatively empty dining room with servers standing around. (note: it got busy soon thereafter).\n\n  We were offered tap or bottled water (we chose tap, with no snooty reaction when that was our choice), and served an amuse bouche before we knew it. It was a wonderful smoked trout with beans bruschetta.  Delicious.  Between the four of us (one drank beer...he was the designated driver), we ordered a bottle of red and a bottle of white.  With our deal we had a choice of 3 whites and 3 reds. We went with the chardonnay and the cabernet.  The wine guy here is awesome!  Friendly, and well, perfect service! I LOVED that he gave each of us wine drinkers a glass for the red and a glass for the white and served them at the same time, so WE could choose what went best with which foods.  He presented wine the \"proper\" way without it feeling stuffy and pretentious.  Truly memorable! And we liked both of them very much.\n\n    We were brought two kinds of bread with a pea puree/pesto type spread that was light and delicious, topped off with a nice quality olive oil.  Both breads were excellent...one of which was a sundried tomato focaccia...  the other was just a good basic bread that was probably my favorite.\n\n    For our deal menu, we had our choice between three first courses, four seconds, and two desserts.  We two gals went with the blue crab ravioli, the stuffed trout, and the peach daiquiri dessert.  Guys went with the bolognese tagliatelle and, the steak dish, and the panna cotta dessert.\n\n   I wish their website was working tonight (it hasn't been working all day), or I would quote accurate descriptions of these amazing dishes, but let me just say that they were all PERFECT, fresh, and amazing!  I have had trout at The Mint in Raleigh that was flat-out awful.  This trout was unbelievably good! It was stuffed with spinach and onions and fontina and cooked to perfection. The white asparagus with it was just the right texture with a nice tangy balsamic that went so well with the rich fish.  I've never cared for fish skin before but this was crispy and beyond delicious.  I tell you, this chef needs to go on Chopped or Iron Chef, and please let me be a judge!  I could go on and on, but I wasn't the only one happy. We ALL were.  The bolognese was full of flavor and the homemade pasta was cooked perfectly al dente..loved the little spice kick to it. Ravioli with fava beans...rich and a very generous serving...the tomatoes in the dish were the perfect sweet/acidic addition.  Guys LOVED their steaks. I managed to steal a tiny taste before I was almost stabbed with a fork (just kidding).  It was GREAT.  They all raved about the mushrooms (I don't do mushrooms, so I can't relate), and the side dish was a green creamy delicious treat that I cannot properly describe nor properly name.\n\n    Coffee...excellent.  Dessert...again, very good. The peach one was a little parfait glass layered with creamy, fruity goodness, served next to a \"rum baba\".  Uh, what?  It was a small dinner roll that had supposedly been soaked in rum? It wasn't overpowering though, so all I know was, it was good cut up and put in the dish with the creamy fruit.  The panna cotta with blueberry sauce was also good, with a crunchy cookie type topping.\n\n   Now, not only was service excellent, but we never even had to show our discount \"postcard\".  The discount was taken off our bill automatically.  Even with a more than twenty percent tip that we happily paid, this dinner was well under $100 for two.  \n\n    We will not only be back, but will continue to rave about this meal for a long time!", "type": "review", "business_id": "dje3fr7pL6_OjA_OhFasKA"}

There was only one other group there at the time so seating wasn't an issue. The place seems to be fairly low key Sunday mornings (or at least this morning).

The layout is pretty open so even on a full day it wouldn't be crammed (common complaint for some brunch places).   \n\nI ordered the Go Green! egg-white Scramble (basil-marinated portobella / fried green tomatoes / fresh mozzarella / basil cashew pesto) and my friend got the Kathy Bates Bennie (Eggs benedict that consists of 2 crispy oat waffles, fried green tomatoes, poached eggs,  hollandaise-of course-and avocado smash). Portions were very generous. Eating buddy loved his eggs benedict. I had a bite myself and they were yummy. I liked my scramble as well. Sweet potato latkas were good; very comfort food-like. My only critique was the amount of liquid in my plate. I'm guessing cooking with that much veggies, some fluid comes out but it made the eggs a little wetter than I would have liked (mostly an issue towards the end of the meal). It was all still delicious but definitely would have liked less water. The excess water could have also accounted for the egg tasting a bit bland. To be fair, I love salty so I am very sensitive to food that is under-salted even a tad. \n\nAnyway I would certainly come back! I really would like to try a waffle next time (got my eye on the sweet cinnamon waffle with nutella ice cream).

Rachel, or I guess she also goes by Raquel, did my hair. I wanted a Brazilian Keratin Treatment on my natural hair, but I decided to try them out with a wash and set first. They got my hair really straight, and at first I was really pleased with how straight they got my nautral hair! I was happy until the next time I washed my hair. Clumps of my hair came out. CLUMPS. Like ten 1-2 inch balls of hair all over the shower floor.  And really long clumps, like it was either breaking from near the root or coming out like shedding. I nearly cried in the shower. My hair continued to shed like this for two more washings. :-(\n\nFlashback. The only thing I'd done differently to my hair in the past few days was go to this salon. I asked for a wash and set. The lady (not Rachel) washed my hair, my natural hair, very vigorously so as to knot it up. Mistake number one. Then, mistake number two, she tried to comb it from the root out! Yeah, that didnt work! All I heard was my hair snapping, snarling and breaking. I had to break out my Denman brush and show her the way. Then, in Spanish...  and I hate this! I hate when they talk in Spanish around you. It's very rude. But I speak Spanish, so I understood her when she told the other hairdresser how tough my hair was. I'm thinking, \"Oh boy, here we go again...\" She then offered to put a \"hot oil treatment\" in my hair, for free! Rachel recommended it too. I obliged.\n\nFast forward to the roller set. She needed help to roll my hair (too coily for her :-( ). Rachel took over at this point. Then when blow drying I keep hearing my poor strands snapping and breaking. The end result was typical, dead straight and really flat with a little curl at the end and lots of shining oils. I'm not a fan. :-( But I pay the bill and tip her well. Then the next time I wash my hair, it fell out in clumps and the texture was different. It was more rough and a lot less coily. Some parts were wavy. I'm positive it was the \"hot oil treatment\" that caused the clumps of hair to fall out. Anyhow, that was my first and last experience with them. You have been warned!!! BTW, this experience was in July 2011.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C58LwszasVKIqFsKfQhIGA"}

The grits was delicious as well.\nDesserts are tasty and well-made (I suggest the pineapple upside-down cake). Good wine and drinks list.\n\nThe restaurant interiors are nice, with a modern yet traditional feeling (it seems to be in Colorado rather than in Ithaca!).

Friday's used to have one of the better happy hours in the general UCSD area, but ever since switching to the new Sunday and bar only specials, there isn't much point for students to go to enjoy some good deals on appetizers and drinks after a late night of studying or for their friends' birthdays.  This particular trip was inspired by a friends' birthday celebration and was a throwback to our old student days.\n\nFeeling a bit hungrier than just an appetizer, I decided to go with the Cheesy Bacon Cheeseburger.  Accompanied by a \"Snakebite\", this combination makes for the classic burger and beer combo.  The burger was pretty tasty and moist, but what makes this burger unique is its inclusion of a sliced of fried provolone cheese.  You would expect that it be kind of melted, but it was sort of just a solid patty of fried cheese.  It was OK, but definitely not what I expected.  I found the fries to be disappointingly over seasoned as well.\n\nTurning away their core demographic is a silly move in an attempt to increase profits.  Even sitting at the bar level doesn't count toward their happy hour specials and only applies if you sit at the bar itself.  As a student, Friday's used to be one of my favorite comfort places, but it has since lost most of its personality and charm.

All these food critics aren't kidding when they say the egg salad sandwich at Euro Pane is one of the best around (it was featured on Jonathan Gold's list of things to eat in LA before you die, and also on the Food Network's \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\"). It really is a seriously kick-ass sandwich.\n\nNow, listen folks. I love egg salad. A lot. In all of its many forms. But there's something about the egg salad at Euro Pane that puts it high above the rest. Most versions of egg salad that I've seen in my day are wet cement-like (albeit delicious) concoctions of diced hard boiled eggs held together with tons of mayo. The eggs in Euro Pane's salad are only medium boiled, giving the yolks a runnier consistency, and cut into larger chunks rather than diced or mashed. As a result, the integrity of the egg itself is kept in tact and you can really savor the egg flavor, rather than the mayo-heavy taste you get from most other versions. Add a squirt of lemon juice and some arugala on top of a couple of slices of sourdough and you've got one awesome sandwich.\n\nThe egg salad alone deserves 5 stars but there are some misses here. My dining partner ordered the roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich which was way too heavy on the peppers and, as a result, significantly less satisfying. Also, the oft-discussed macarons were tasty enough and came in a nice assortment of flavors, but the filling could be creamier. There are better macarons out there (make a trip to NY or Vegas to visit Bouchon Bakery and see for yourself).", "type": "review", "business_id": "UsrKX2305OkmeI7K7cizjA"}

It's affordable but a little bit on the pricey side. The menu is broken up by sides, proteins, and sauces. If they didn't close so early I would eat there after work all the time! \n\nTheir salmon is delicious! You have to get it with steamed vegetables, basmati rice, and the apple aoli sauce! The sauce is sooooo good! \n\nTheir blackened chicken is juicy and flavorful. They have a mustard sauce that goes w this or you can choose one of their lemon sauces! \n\nI love their pasta sald with balsamic vinegar and cherry tomatoes! This place is very good!!! Yay for D.

From the first time I walked into this gorgeous building...I knew that this would be one of my favorite places in Atlanta. It's hard to put into words how beautiful this theater. I honestly feel, as if, I've stepped back in time whenever I walk through their doors. So many great people/groups have performed here...you can feel that history. \n\nA few things to note...\n* Concessions are pretty good here...variety of food and drinks, as well as two large bars. They also sell coffee drinks, which is a bonus if you have a boyfriend who loves espresso like mine. \n* The ceiling of the theater...there are no words how beautiful it is. It's a beautiful night sky...just lovely. \n* Bathroom lines can tend to be long...so I suggest sneaking out a few moments before intermission to go. \n* The Fox website has a feature when purchasing tickets where you are able to see the actual view of the stage of where your seat will be. It's pretty cool. I honestly don't think there is a bad seat in the house though. I've been close to the stage and far back in the balcony and have enjoyed every show.\n\nI've seen such a variety of shows here. To name a few...Oklahoma, Wicked, Cats, Phantom (traveling Broadway), My Morning Jacket, Widespread Panic, Stomp (musical shows), Alvin Ailey (dance) and a bunch of Atlanta Ballet shows (Nutcracker, Romeo & Juliet, Swan Lake).\n\nBottom-line - everyone (artists, comedians, dance companies) want to perform on this stage. There's nothing better than that.  \n\nOk...sometimes ticket prices can be a tad high, but if your resourceful...you can find discounted nights for most shows. Or...you can always go to a matinee...they tend to be lower. \n\nOverall...if you have never experienced this magical place...I highly suggest to buy tickets for the next show they have.

The catch? It's only available after 9 o'clock on Sundays and, barring a food allergy, is completely predetermined by the chef. I have no problem leaving my meal in the hands of a James Beard award-winning chef, but others might. My friend and I, who are always looking for fine-dining at affordable prices, stumbled across the Chef's Whim, and knew we had to try it. We had both been to Craigie before and been disappointed, but saw this as an opportunity to set things right.\n\nWe actually opted for the $55 six-course meal, but could have easily done with the cheaper version. Everything was the same between the two tasting menus (as we saw firsthand with the table ordering next to us), except for two supplemental courses, a cheesy pumpkin soup with grilled cheese and pork belly (rich and decadent, and maybe worth the extra cost alone), and a scoop of blackberry sorbet (lame, and a waste of a \"course\").\n\nThe dishes that overlapped in both menus ranged from good to excellent. My favorite was probably the cod cheek tempura, served with pickled peppers, preserved lemon, and a decent smattering of squid ink. There was a lot of salt in this dish, but it was not overpowering in the slightest. Seared swordfish with clams, whelks, and \"early fall succotash\" (which my friend aptly described as the vegetable portion of a tv dinner) came next. It was light and refreshing, and the sea critters were cooked perfectly.\n\nOur main entree, if you will, was a chicken thigh confit that was rather hard to dissect, both physically and flavor-wise. I wrote down the laundry list of ingredients presented by the waiter, but had trouble pinpointing some of them within the dish. I'm still drooling, however, thinking of the skin on our chicken. I may be 6'1\" and a lean 170 lbs, but I'm a fatty through and through. Now onto dessert. : )\n\nAfter my previous brunch here included sour milk panna cotta, I was a little disappointed to see it served for dinner as well. It is a delicious and texturally complex dish (the coriander casher granola is a perfect accompaniment), but I wish I got to try something different--preferably something with chocolate. For $40, I will definitely be back some Sunday in hopes of having my wish granted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA"}

The drag, however, is the one spot off this list that I probably dread making the tour of the most.  It seems more like a memorial ground than a tourist spot to me.  \n\nWalking down that long stretch of Guadalupe, from 21st to 25th, I hardly remember what it looked like when I was a student at UT.

And then it fell, yet another casualty and a sign of our changing times.  For a while it stood empty, and walking by you could still see the colorful prints on the walls that gave Tower a lot of its street cred and funk.  And I almost wondered if it would stay empty as a symbol of all that the drag has traded in exchange for more dollah dollah bills.  Intellectual Property, however, has now filled its space with books where Vinyl and CD's once stood.

There were only 3 tables left, 1 literally touching the front glass of the pastry display case, 1 blocking the kitchen exit, & a 6 top right in the thick of it.  A guy, who ended up being our waiter that night suggested the we take the one in front of the pastry counter, said it was the least molested & we took his suggestion.  I quickly ordered 2 Turkish beers, said to be like Shiner & Budweiser, of which I quickly disagreed.  They tasted more like a Killians Red (even though not red in color), & a Heineken, both good.  On the table free of cost, like chips & salsa, a sesame pita thing w/ a sesame & spice dip that is awesome!!!\n\nI was happy to see the beers come out fast & even happier when the waiter actually started taking interest in our having the best dinning experience possible.  I always ask the wait staff \"What is good?\"  I figure they are there all the time, they should know, or work somewhere else.  SIDE NOTE: (I hate it when I'm told \"Everything, or I don't have a favorite.\"  In addition, I don't like it when they say something like, I like the salad, or the burger, just because.  This tells me that they, & possibly the restaurant, has no imagination what-so-ever & is not taking pride in the food that they do have.)  The waiter promptly took the normal stance that we were American scaredy cats & that we are looking for Americanized safe food.  Oh contrar mona mi.  I have been half way around the world, food is my hobby!!!  So I proceeded to pry out of him what he likes on the menu, because frankly, I'm pretty sure he was Turkish!!!  lol.  After letting down his normal guard, he proceeded to tell us the things on the menu that he really likes & why.  Come to find out they are the things that are closest to what his mom makes him at home!!!  He suggested 4 things, paired w/ one another because each enhances the taste of the other.  We proceeded to order the full sampler because it had all 4, the suggested 4, plus 4 more!!!  If you get this sampler, be sure you have 4 people or more...lol  It comes with pickled beens, picked leeks, the yogurt sauce, egg plant salad, humus, a Turkish pico, & I forget the other 2.  I loved the pico, yogurt & humus the best  They pickle everything in Turkey I guess...lol  They give you the sesame pita like thing to dip in these samplers as well.  When it arrived the waiter was sure to explain to us all 8 of the items & bring us more pita.\n\nFor the entre we ordered the Turkish pizza which is a very thin pita w/ a \"lamb spread\" on it, then baked, but not to crunchy status.  I wondered why, but not for long because along comes the waiter again w/ instructions on how to eat the pizza.  You load it up w/ all the vegetables that were served on the side, then roll it up like a tortilla & eat it.  We were then again surprised by the waiter when he brought us a double shot glass sized glass full of what reminds me of the Indian salty lassy yogurt drink.  He tells us, take a bite of the rolled pizza, then a drink of the salty drink, & guess what?  It was perfect!!!  No better match of drink & food could be made.  Along w/ the Turkish pizza, we got a plate of lamb kabobs & rice w/ more side vegetables, pickled of course...lol  This was also good, but by this time I was stuffed, so I didn't eat as much of it.  I did however have a little of a sweet tooth after that meal though &asked what the waiter suggested.  With a Grinch like grin on his face, he told us that he had the perfect desert, but it was off menu, & $5.  Would we be interested?  Of course we were!!!  He hadn't been wrong all night!  A couple minutes later he brings out this little aluminum Turkish looking skillet, very hot, & in the middle is a couple of their \"hay stack\" looking things, smashed down into a pancake, soaked in maybe honey & butter & browned?  On top of it is a tiny scoop of heaven, otherwise known as Belgian Cream...  Of all the Mediterranean, or Turkish deserts that I have ever had, this has been the best & I would recommend it every time.  The waiter actually made it for us himself, & it is his favorite dessert that his mom makes!!! We also ordered a Turkish coffee (kinda like an espresso shot), & a Turkish hot tea (like a double shot of hot English breakfast tea).  Ladies, ask to have them tell your story from the coffee cup!!!  A perfect & wonderful ending to a perfect & wonderful meal & night.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant to all those interested in good & authentic Turkish food w/ great service & a very good price.  With 4 drinks, a 4 person appetizer, 2 entres, an off the menu dessert, a Turkish coffee, & a hot Turkish tea, our bill was under $50.  Not bad for 2 full hours of eating, which only seemed like 45 minute.  Better then Fadi's!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rb0h5mLEKRiaPEpToVUjiw"}

I remember that spring day like it was yesterday. I almost jizzed my pants here that day. It's very basic, as other Pho 75 locations are. They have Pho and that's about it. No appetizers, no pork chops, nada.\n\nThe Pho here justifies the absence of other dishes though. Pho is really good most of the time. I say most of the time because, just like any other Pho places, it can be a little different day to day, and that is totally acceptable because bones and meats all don't come from the same cow. They come from happy cows, sad cows, and bikerbitch cows.\n\nGetting back to the Pho, sit down, order, and whatever you ordered will be out in front of you in less than 2 minutes. I guarantee this and am willing to bet both of Anson P.'s thumbs on this. I've been here 4 times in the past few weeks, and it's been good to great every time. Almost the same as I remember from back on that spring day in 1991. Noodles are cooked just right, meats are nice and tender and juicy, tendon is tendony, and the broth is ALWAYS piping hot. Like burn your tongue and mouth hot. The dish of sprouts, basil, jalapenos, lime, and sometimes culantro is usually fresh. Maybe being a local chain has its merits.\n\nStill one of my favorite Pho places in the DC area. Nice and dirty. I made a revelation during my meal here. I ordered a large #1 with NOTHING ELSE.

I appreciate the generous avocado spread, but the burger gets really mushy and super messy. The bread is probably what disgusts me the most. It's not firm enough and the patty slips back and forth while you eat it.\n\nThe FRENCH FRIES are good for the first 10 minutes and then they start to get soggy and limp: 2 adjectives that should never be used to describe french fries. I appreciate their effort to be \"healthy,\" but I like my fries crispy! The garlic is real garlic (none of that garlic powder), so the taste is extremely strong. Bring some mints if you plan on going back to class or to meet up with friends.\n\nMy friends often get their salads, which seem pretty big but it seems like they get the salads for the cornbread. I'm not a fan of cornbread so you won't see me with one of their plain looking salads.\n\nOverall, there are better burger places just down the street from here.

But don't worry, you'll be pampered as much as you want.\n\nThe piece de resistance is the excellent wine list, all available by the glass or taste (1/3rd of a glass.)  This is a great place to learn about wines - they have a very eclectic selection of wines, lots of good local ones but also wines from around the world.  The wine list alone makes this a place that should be experienced at one time or another.  Where else can you compare three of the best Cabernets to three of the best Zinfandels on the market?\n\nthe creme brulee was also excellent, and I consider myself a creme brulee expert, having tasted it in over 10 states and 7 countries.  i would put it in the top 5 %.

It was almost as good as the creme brulee at La Boheme in Carmel, the best we have ever had (alas, La Boheme is no more, but their recipe lives on at their old web site.)\n\nI highly recommend this as an excellent steak house.

I went to 3 dermatologists in the bay area that even my  friends recommended..All of 'em prescribed me different kinds of antibiotics.  It was a horrible experience.  I had huge acne all over my face up to the top of my scalp and my back.  I knew something was wrong because I was noticing that my lips were  turning black from taking oral antibiotics and topical as well.  With all these frustrations, I was so desperate and tried to go online and look for a dermatologist of  my choice.   I got to tell ya'll, I felt like it was a gamble to find one-- not knowing who would be the best one for my case.  Luckily, I found Dr. Berman.  He was intimidating at first.  Just because, he asks me first   thing, what I think was wrong with my skin.  And I'm like--well, I needed help that's why I got to see you...I mean \"i DON'T kNOW, DUH???  Then so, he checked my chest, back and tummy to see any unwanted hair growing.  And he explained to me that it could be some hormonal imbalance that I am experiencing.  So, he asked me to see an OB-gyn..And I was like--that's weird....But as desperate as I was , I thought, I'd do whatever it takes, and followed his advice.  True enough, it was some sort of abnormality...I never thought that having irregular period is REALLY a  hormonal thing.  To cut my story short,  My acne starts to diminish after like 4 months.  Now, though it sounds too good to be true, I don't see any acne in my face.  My skin color has gone better.  Dr. Berman got everything under control.  Looking back 2 years ago,   I appreciate how my skin got back to its natural glow....Not perfect yet...because I deveoped huge pores and some scaring  from acne but  Dr. Berman gave me several options for treatment .  Microdermabrasion is my favorite because it's working great minimizing my large pores.  It is a little bit expensive though but it's all worth it.   Just go and check it out .  I know!  I know...Dr. Berman could be intimidating but he won't bite!  The only bad thing I'd have to say about his practice is that the COFFEE MACHINE DOESN'T MAKE GOOD COFFEE.  NEEDS SOME SERVICE DONE ON THIS MACHINE!!!  Look for Nora  to set-up an appointment.  She's very sweet and thoughtful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wjduYVeMEkp--A-hwDOvvQ"}

The place is smaller than I would think from the outside probably because it is divided into two almost with an \"express\" side on one side and the sit down restaurant on the other. As we entered, you could see the beautiful modern decor with interesting lighting chandeliers and a bar area adjacent. You could also smell the seafood so if you dont like fish, you might want to go elsewhere. Most of the people that came in (mostly male on this Monday night) sat at the bar for some reason. We were the only ones sitting down at the tables. According to this website, the restaurant seats 50 people but I would say it seemed like it sat less. \n\nThe bar tender/waitress was very nice but was a little slow in anticipating what we would need (had to ask for silverware, drink refills, salt/pepper) but otherwise was very friendly. We ordered off the Harlem week prix fixe so it was cheaper than their regular menu. Appetizers on the menu were pretty tipical ~$9 or so with interesting menu choices such as calamari, lobster and shrimp roll, etc. Follow by entrees which were a little pricier as expected for seafood from $20-$50 (lobster). It is also the first time I have been asked how I would like my seafood cooked (grilled,broiled, fried and rare, medium, well). I picked a medium grilled salmon and it was yummy. It came with a very well flavored and textured mashed potatoes. My bf got grilled cod with a mixed vegetable medley. The vegetables were perfection- well seasoned, good crunch. The cod though was not good, it lacked flavor- needed a sauce or more seasoning or something but still edible. For dessert, I had the chocolate pecan pie which was delicious but I would have preferred it to be warmer. He had the chocolate cookie which I did not enjoy but the waitress was sweet and brought him milk with his cookie.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the food here but it is on a regular downtown menu price which is fine but wont be going here every day. THey also had combination platters that looked interesting that I would try when I get around to coming back (shrimp, lobster, fish, etc). Ambiance-wise, the place has nice modern decor but the crowd is typical harlem crowd I would say. Also I believe the owner is the DJ and plays good music as you dine. I enjoyed the music the entire time. One suggestion would be to have nice sauce to put atop/along side of their perfectly cooked fish to add to the flavor of the dish.\n\nP.S. THis place is clearly not a beer place as they have no draft beer, only bottled and a limited selection of bottled beer that they do carry.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8fDhtPpDAnFN44LVUIe3qQ"}

To give a bit of background, I love food and tend to give most restaurants 4 stars. This place really disappointed me.\n\nI ordered the half rotisserie chicken and 1 side, and chose the salad as my side. The chicken was tasty, but honestly was not any better than the grocery store deli rotisserie chickens. In fact, the skin seem particularly fatty underneath, and there were several spots where the skin and meat were overcooked to a dry stringy mess. The meat did not \"fall off the bone,\" as some reviewers have said. The green sauce was also tasty, but actually rather bland, and did not compensate for the overall mediocre flavor of the chicken. The salad was literally several piece of iceberg lettuce, a couple slices of tomato and cucumber, and what tasted like Wishbone bottled Italian dressing. I ate in the restaurant, and when I asked for tortillas, I was told that it would be 75 cents for two tortillas.\n\nThe run-down looking restaurant has zero ambience, with old plastic booths, and the food was served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. The service, while cordial enough, was not particularly friendly or enthusiastic. I'm no cheapskate, and will gladly pay good money for delicious food or a nice ambience; but for the quality of food that I got, and the rather depressing feel of the place, I did not think the experience was at all worth the $8.50 I spent there.\n\nI hate to give negative reviews, especially to small businesses, but I felt I had to add my honest 2 cents to all the oddly positive reviews listed here.

The $5/meal is pretty decent until they charge you an extra $2 for lo mein instead of rice.  But the biggest thing that bothers me is the huge puddle of oil that the food sits in.  Again, I'm not a health freak but eatting this food just made me feel guilty.  With every bite, I think about getting a heart attack at 27.  There's as much oil as there sauce and you see the thick oil floating above. don't expect a fantastic dining area either.  it's dark and feels icky.  \n\nI've had my fair share of cheap chinese food, and this is probably the worst I've tried.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MBirSnTW4pt2k7Ny6KC72w"}

I walk by this place all the time when I'm in Westwood, and for some reason, had the impression that it was some cool Irish/British joint from the outside. Stupid me. \n\nWe sat down and took one look at the menu, and it was anything but. It was probably one of the most random menus I've ever seen in my life. They had all sorts of food, but I don't think it translated in a good way. It really had no focus, and it was shown in the quality of the food they put out. \n\nI ordered the clam chowder... I don't know what it was, but it was definitely not clam chowder. It tasted sour! Ew. So I didn't really have much to eat that night. Their onion rings were okay, but I think every American bar should get that down, so no kudos for okay onion rings. Rick said his burger was okay.\n\nBut it is a bar, and we still had fun despite the bad food. Its a great place to hang out and to drink. It got pretty rowdy in there, with all the karaoke. It's one of those bars that decorates by sticking random objects, pictures and gadgets on their walls and ceilings, which is fine by me. Kinda cool looking at all the random stuff. We talked, enjoyed a couple Tecate beers and watched Caddyshack on their many TVs. \n\nBottom line: I'd come here to drink, but not to eat.\n\nJen\nwww.foodforhunters.blogspot.com", "type": "review", "business_id": "t0Jua5Oo9247QorSQ1WzPw"}

First of all, it's crazy cheap. Like, eat-a-whole-meal-for-less-than-five-bucks cheap. The food isn't breaking down culinary barriers or anything, but it is definitely tasty. The sandwiches are especially good -- my favorites are the Grendel (roast beef with boursin cheese) and the French dip. Everything comes out super quickly; I don't think I've ever waited longer than 10 minutes for my food to arrive. I never have to worry that I won't make it back to the office in time when I come to Grendel's. \n\nThe service is solid. Grendel's isn't the kind of place where your waiter is going to fawn over you and make tons of idle chatter, but every server I've had has been pleasant and accommodating. I once asked for steamed veggies (not on the menu) instead of the standard potato chips with my sandwich, and the server didn't even bat an eye. I wasn't charged extra either, which was a nice surprise.

I read tons of reviews of restaurants on Yelp and decided to go here. It had pretty decent reviews and the menu that I found online looked good as well. \n\nIt went downhill from the moment we walked inside. We went on a weekday evening during finals week (I'm a student on campus) and there were only a few tables filled (by few, I mean literally 3 tables). We waited 5 minutes before we were even addressed, even though my boyfriend and I were the only people waiting in the front. It took another 7 minutes to seat us in an almost completely empty restaurant. \n\nWe received our menus and some bread (which was good) and water. The waitress came by to announce the specials, one of which included some udon noodle dish which confused me because they do not fit the cuisine of the restaurant (Latin American-esque vs. japanese), which I thought was odd. \n\nBeing from Chicago, and having experienced real Latin American/\"American\" food, as well as actual good food, I would definitely not label this restaurant as it has been.\n\nWe ended up ordering the phyllo-wrapped lamb and the beef stew. When the food came, I couldn't help but notice how limp the \"vegetables\" were. They looked like they had been defrosted from a bag of mixed vegetables. The mashed potatoes that came with the meal were also just so-so. It had big chunks in it, like they didn't even take the time to mash them all the way. \n\nThe lamb was alright. It was cooked well, pink in the middle, but the goat cheese on the outside (between the phyllo and lamb) was overpowering. The beef stew my boyfriend had was accompanied by the same limp vegetables and half mashed potatoes. The stew itself was nothing special either. \n\nWe didn't order drinks or anything extra, and our bill was still over $45. It was hardly worth the price for the amount or quality of food we got. \n\nI definitely will never go back. The food was less than inspiring and the service was horrible.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e9shtyZ7-9GYcbPIVV--XQ"}

Here's the story. We walk in and are told that we need to wait for a table. So we're patiently waiting, and then we notice a woman bitching out the staff there, because she noticed that there were many open tables, but she was still being told to sit and wait like we were. I later realize that they're not seating us not because there aren't available tables, but because they were short on staff and they couldn't handle having more tables occupied by patrons. Anyway, we finally sit, I order a beer and my girlfriend orders a mango margarita. After a long time of waiting for our drinks, the waiter comes back and asks us what we ordered again. We tell him, and he apologizes and says it's because apparently he's like the only waiter working the whole restaurant that night or something. Anyway, we get our drinks, and my girlfriend's is a white color...definitely not mango. We tell them this and they come out with the proper mango margarita and tell us that the other one is free...so my girlfriend is sitting there with 2 huge margaritas in front of her. So then we order our food and it is decent, we're eating...and all of a sudden a busser walks by, heading to the kitchen holding a tray of dirty dishes. However, he doesn't realize that the tray had a spilled Coke on it, so basically as he was walking by he was splashing Coke on the people in my row, including my girlfriend. Not only that, upon realizing that he is splashing people with Coke, he doesn't even apologize, but instead just places extra napkins on each table for us to wipe ourselves off with. Are you kidding me?? A guy sitting on another table alerts the manager about the Coke splashed on him and the manager tells him his entree is free. I decide to call him over and speak my mind too, and so my girlfriend gets her entree free as well. Later, as we are about to leave, a guy who just started eating in a table next to us says in horror: \"Oh my God, my chicken is raw!\" At this point we decide to escape this nightmarish experience and go home. This place would normally get 1 star, but I decided to be nice and bump it up because we did end up getting a free drink and meal that night, and I'm cheap like that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HdGDvsK8jEdstSS5g21FDg"}

Also there is a butcher when you first come in and they wear baseball caps and are def. not Amish) and the prices are reasonable, and everything is clearly marked and displayed. I finally was able to find here the thick-cut bacon that I love to use in my recipes (after resorting to regular bacon or worse, ham) at a good price. I also love their fresh pretzels, their selection of cheese, butter (5 bucks for a sleeve the size of my arm of butter! nuts!). Their vegetable section could stand to carry more things, but I don't know how that works. Anyway, also the last Saturday of each month they have a pig roast. I've never gotten anything from the snack bar during those times, but I've seen their giant pulled pork sandwiches and people gorging themselves on them, so they can't be that bad. \n\nNote- only opened Thursday-Saturday. When I use to work at home on Thursdays, I would go and it wouldn't be that bad. Saturday mornings are nightmares, so sometimes I even wait until 2 to go when the crowds thin out.  The Saturday morning crowds are also a bit nuts, and be prepared to be pegged in the shin by many a shopping cart.

If you show your Bruin ID you get a discount. Hell, I've been to Hurry Curry and didn't have my card and they let it slide and said it was cool. This is the only place I've ever been to which offers a UCLA discount with an ID card where every single person has to show their card. The server insisted that EACH INDIVIDUAL PRESENT A CARD. What the fuck? We're two ASIANS IN WESTWOOD. It doesn't get more UCLA than that? Why do we need to present a card for each individual? Have you had too many issues in your few months of existence with those Sneaky UCLA kids pawnin' their cards off to one another? So..... If we're a group of 4 Individuals eatin at your restaurant all 4 of us need to present our card? I didn't know that Panini Cafe turned into UCLA Powell Library at night? Who knew? At least if didn't show my card here I wouldn't get tased.....  I think it's in poor taste that for a family of two UCLA Bruins you couldn't just use one card. The mere fact that you made my Sister walk like 15 mins in her 4 inch heels just so she could get her card? 20% is a huuuuge price difference? It's just silly. This kinda overally put a damper mood at my experience here. I gave it a 2 star ratin' because in all honesty yes Overall.... It's not bad. If you're a UCLA student and have a card use it. If you have a trustfund and don't care about a discount than whatever.............. \"Meh.

One can seat about 6 or 7 people, the other can seat four. The other three can seat two. That's 17 people. There are also about 10 stools at the bar. So if you come in with a group and the big table is taken, you're pretty much going to be looking for another place to eat. This place is TINY.\n\nI'd actually call it almost a romantic dinner type of place if it didn't smell so awful (sorry I'll stop complaining now). But one more thing, our wet, greasy waiter also smelled like he just came off the fisherman's boat. Was he the cook AND the waiter? Possibly.\n\nOn the plus side, he was very jolly and attentive. Super nice, besides him almost not letting us eat because there were four of us with the POSSIBILITY of a fifth person, and the big table was already taken.\n\nSo while I was there, I got a bento box. Steak skewers, noodles, slaw and edamame. The steak skewers tasted a little funky, like they were cooked along with the fish. So I only ate a few bites of those. The noodles were not good. The edamame was very undersalted (if you want good Edamame, go to Ebisu!), and I'd have to say the best part of the bento box was the coleslaw. For 15 bucks.\n\nThe portions for anything else were TINY. My friend got the shrimp plate and got, I think, four or five shrimp. I think it was 8 bucks or so.\n\nThe one redeeming quality of this place is that they have crushed ice, which generally excites me.\n\nI won't ever come back here. It wasn't the service or even the mediocre food, but the smell of seafood in such a tiny place was just nauseating. Sorry Ama's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LLMIzRMVcu_F7gwfdY_wSQ"}

GOOD CHOICE ON MY PART\n\nI ordered one of the Bottled Orange Cream Sodas (sounded good, but I'll probably get the root beer next time)\n\nDesign:\nWe walked to a table near the back and sat down, observing the cool and sleek cozy city style of the place. \nI really liked how they chose mat paint for the walls-very modern.\nThe tables were really cool-huge dark wood slats on wheels with trendy stools to match. \nThe lighting was perfect (finally a restaurant that GETS IT) I don't want lights blinding me while I'm trying to eat much less have a conversation.\nTop it off with some tunes and I'm happy- good job Dog Haus.\n\nDidn't take TOO long for our food to arrive...As soon as I got my dog I was excited to check out their extensive condiments bar---NICE TOUCH!\n\nWith a little mayo and some spicy mustard I'm good to Grub-don't wanna take away from the flavors.\n\nTHE DOG:\n*The Bun was Soft and Sweet...YUM!\n*The hot dog was Delicious and Juicy-no burning my tongue here!\n*The Bacon was COOKED to PERFECTION-no chewy fatty pieces, perfectly crisped, thick cut bacon-OMFG\n*Avacado-Very fresh and vibrant green-I'm happy guys.. really.\n*The Egg was \"over Medium\" no white gooey parts-pure golden glaze--yumm\n*The TOTS-perfect (but lets be honest, who can screw up tots)\n\nNeedless to say the dog was demolished-completely..SOo GOOOOD\n\nBut what about the Bleu Cheese Sweet Potato Fries?? Well guys don't get too excited cause I'll never order them again-i thought it was gonna be chunks of blue cheese, but it was a dressing and it was NOT good.\n\nI'll get the fries again, but not the Blue Cheese Ones...\n\n$$$=super reasonable-around 6 bucks for a delicious loaded dog.\n\nThey also have brats and burgers-I'm coming back for sure!\n\nOVERALL I wish i could rate them a 4.5 but i can't--so they get a 5 due to the fact they the dogs are so CREATIVE and DELICIOUS-the quality of the food is spot on and the condiment bar is very unique and diverse.

A huge line edging around the alleyway are the norm so I swooped in today when I saw that there were relatively few people waiting in line. The customer service was as sweet as the frosting - but, like the cupcakes, was lacking in anything that involved complexity. I feel like the line is built from intentionally slow service to build up hype. I ordered the hot red velvet, black and white and got the free cupcake of the day (chocolate marshmallow). They have a habit of taking their sweet time boxing up the cupcakes before finishing up your order. They accidentally gave my order to another person and totally forgot about my order. I brought it up with the cashier and she quickly checked the tickets and said I was next. Nothing else. Next was 10 minutes later after I asked again. I was charged for my free cupcake and I had to go back to get it remedied. The cupcakes were well packaged, I'll give it that.\n\nThe cupcakes were lovely little things though. The taste? The frosting is decent but all sugar - cut it with plenty of milk. The cakes didn't really have a chocolate flavor but had a good moist texture though. Hype is what keeps this place in business. Including the little snafu, I waited about 1/2 hour and spent 7 bucks on 3 cupcakes. Even if there was another free cupcake involved, I won't be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "roEQNfyPi3jRv3WFFr-f_g"}

To be honest, I was without power and warm water for 12 days, and I was so desperate for clean hair, so I went in for a haircut.  Immediately, I was pleasantly surprised by the salon.  It's huge, so they were able to get me an appointment at the last minute.  Up until this point, I would never have gotten a haircut without getting lots of reviews on the person first.  However, I was desperate, so it's just luck that I ended up with someone so amazing!\n\nMy husband and I loyally go to SHARA for haircuts.  She's amazing!!!  I also get the keratin hair treatment every few months.  I switched to Shara at Beautique, and I haven't looked back to my old salon, an adorable little place in Montrose.  Shara is great at styling, and I've even tried adding color.  Basically, she's awesome!\n\nI used to go to RAZA for bikini waxes.  She made what could be an awkward and uncomfortable situation quick and painless.  I loved her!  The only reason I don't still go to her is because I found a place that is a little less expensive.  I still haven't found anyone who has nearly as much talent at Raza though!\n\nI go to MARCIA for facials and she is so amazing!  I'm trying to balance my dermatologist's medicines with her treatment.  My dermatologist dries out my skin, and yes, I know that's his point.  But I don't want to walk around with skin like sand paper.  Marcia solved my problem skin and now I'm all clear!  I go to her every month and I love her!\n\nBeautique is huge, which can be good and bad.  On the bright side, you can usually get an appointment.  I also love that you can get so many services all at one location.  On the down side, because it's huge, you don't have that charming spa-like atmosphere.  If I was going to a relaxing spa day, I probably wouldn't go to Beautique.

He shaved the area (standard practice, even though I don't have a hairy wrist or anything) and got going.  It was less painful than I was expecting, except when it got sort of closer to my hands, upper wrist.  Other than that, the experience was pretty pleasant.

I had wanted to update my skills, network, and learn more about parts of the industry I am not experienced in. I'd meant to do it for years, but never found time to enroll. I finally enrolled and started classes at the end of 2009 and worked straight through - which I definitely recommend if your schedule and funds permit.\n\nAt its best, the program is educational (though rarely challenging) and facilitates unmatched networking opportunities with students, instructors, and guest lecturers. Different courses touch on many aspects of the industry and the experience is as diverse as the students and instructors in the program. That said, the majority of students, instructors, and classes are based in the Public Works market. If you have a lot of Public Works experience, the program will feel very basic at times. If you're not experienced in Public Work, you're going to learn a lot.\n\nI have to give my highest regards to one instructor, Sean Leonard. He and a handful of others, including Albert Giocamazzi [sp], are tremendously gifted, passionate about their industry, and gracious enough to share their experience and time with students.\n\n At its worst, the program has classes geared towards people with no practical experience in the industry or led by professors who don't have time to fully prepare - in such cases I found myself fighting to stay awake or even show up. The courses are not challenging (except for the law class) unless you want them to be. My best experience in terms of learning new skills came with the online courses taught by Ataa Aly. I studied Revit and MS Project with him. Those classes were great; straight-forward skill building with excellent exercises.\n\nI feel like the program itself is set so students can get what they want out of it. Many people show up every class and actively contribute to the experience, just as many, however, are there because they have to be and act like high school delinquents when they bother showing up at all. Your experience and the value of the program really comes from your fellow students. There were too many classes where the same 2-3 people would participate and the remainder would sit silent. Those classes were the hardest to sit through.\n\nAll in all, I would certainly recommend the program. Still, classes are expensive, starting around $525 for a basic course and going to $750 for courses with computer labs. I think UCLA X should really take a look at their fee schedule. Having completed the course, I feel like the courses were worth maybe $350 - $400 each, nothing near the prices they charge. So if you're not able to blow through the program in one year, definitely take your time. Nothing you learn is going to catapult you to the next level professionally.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3k9PWkWl7WYLySeudeGx6w"}

Also, it came in a huge hunk, so it was unevenly cooked. I mean, seriously, I'm from the midwest...we don't get the opportunity to have the freshest of the fresh seafood.... You'd assume that a micro brewery in Cambridge, MA would do it up right.... yet somehow this establishment totally missed the mark. \n\nThe beer was also really boring... not bad exactly, but for a micro brewery... it was below average. Not enough flavor or character to remember it 1 second after a sip...\n\nObviously, i guess that everyone is allowed a night off or a botched dish, or whatnot, but seriously... based on my one and only experience that I will ever have with this place.... thumbs down... save your money... it sucks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Bmvu1grPzxECp7dxm8zerA"}

I bought a few small packets of essential spices and made a note to come back whenever I wanted to make an interesting recipie where i needed just a bit of spices. Side note: the spices i did buy nothing came out to over a dollar. Granted i bought small amounts i highly doubt i will go through them with any great speed. The spices alone get this place a solid 3 stars. Over priced spices is a pet peeve of mine what can i say. \n\nThe grains were exciting as well but not as much for me as im not a huge baker. Oatmeal seemed well priced and one of my roomates bought some granola that was good. Damn good. So good I have been contimplating stealing it. \n\nFinally I like the idea of a food co-op. Buying from there makes me happy. I like to support local merchants. If I had a steady job I would probably take the hit in the wallet, but i dont, so im not gonna.

The Mee Sum at Pike Place has the most AMAZING hum bow, so I was thinking they would be very similar (due to the confusion of having the same name). I purchased a chicken hum bow and bbq hum bow.

I tried coming back for the bubble tea since my roommate constantly raves about it along with most of her friends. I tried the red bean bubble tea, but it tasted a bit chalky which seemed to be due to using a powder and not mixing very well. Finally, the last time I was here was due to my roommate dragging me here (ok, maybe not literal dragging...but I always make her go to Oasis, so it was my turn to go to her favorite bubble tea place; though, I did not go happily!). I got the strawberry milk tea, which is my regular drink at Oasis and what I usually get to compare bubble tea places. Wow, this was the worst tasting bubble tea I've ever had in my life. It tasted like strawberry flavored medicine, to be exact it tastes like these nasty strawberry chewable zinc vitamins by Zicam. Since I had paid almost $4 for it (including the credit card fee), I tried to force myself to drink it....however, it was so bad I just wanted to throw up every time I took a sip. I can't remember what my roommate got, but it tasted like sprite and was really overkill on the sweetness.

There is no need to order the bigger platter. \n$5 Chips and Salsa-not good. Chips were half stale. Salsa and guac was not tasty.\nMain Dish Chicken Liver-it is like patte. There is so much, so I recommend sharing, but the flavoring was only normal. Actually a little bland for me.\nMain Spinach Salad-tasty. I never had such big fresh spinach leaves. I enjoyed the mix of tangerines, pecans, bacons, and spinach. I recommend this.\nMain Crab Cakes-served 7-8 pieces of crab cakes, but they were size of  scallops. Kind of small sized. Taste was ok. There were chunks of chestnut, which I don't mind, but I thought the chunks were too big and clashed with the crab meat.\n\nThe best was their free fresh raisin bread.

They all usually end up being very similar on 1 fact: the food tastes dulled down. What I mean by that is they cater to a non-Indian crowd, and while the dishes are still tasty they lack that extra zing and kick that comes from an overload of spice. \n\nMaharaja seems more authentic, they are not scared to spice up a dish, to add that little extra spice that gives it an edge versus the other indian restaurants in the city. Now, when I say this I'm not referring to how spicy the food is, I'm referring to the spice flavoring.\n\nI started with the paneer pakora, and they were very good. Not amazing, pretty standard for an Indian place, but you can only do so much with pakora. The paneer was very tasty and they were fried without dripping with oil. \n\nNext, I had the paneer makhani. The paneer was excellent, and the makhani sauce was made just right. Enough spice with a hint of cream, and that fresh tomato zing at the end. Yum!\n\nI finished with the Kulfi Falooda, which was a bit misleading. The Kulfi part was AMAZING. I have had tons of kulfi, in the US and India, and this was spot on. The taste was rich, and the icyness still present.  I was a bit mislead by the falooda. The falooda dish is one of my favorites, and there is a very specif way to make it. One of the ingredients is this white spaghetti of sorts that's mixed into rose milk. The dish we ordered had the bed of spaghetti over which the kulfi was served. I wouldn't call that falooda, and the noodles detracted from the taste of the kulfi. Honestly, if they just cut out the noodles and served an extra piece of kulfi, I would be in heaven.\n\nBesides the food, the restaurant is very classy, located on the 2nd floor of a building, across the hall from Shabu-Ya. The decor is excellent, the ambience very nice, albeit fairly noisy. It's a large space and excellent for groups. Enjoy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9S4WSPE3r1Bg9KgIlTqpA"}

I waited in line for about 40 minutes to get an americanized burrito.  It was decently yummy but definitely overpriced and definitely took too long.  Considering Chipotle used to be partially owned by McDonald's, I would expect the speed to be a little bit more... speedy? If McDonald's is anything it's quick.\n\nIt's decent food but uhm this is California and there's real, and way more delicious, Mexican food all around.  Also, quac is extra on top of the burrito already being overpriced.  I am a firm believer in quacamole on all (food-related) things Mexican and am usually willing to pay the extra $.50-1.50.  Not here.\n\nThe best part about my visit here was that it was the night of the Emmy's.  When we were walking back to campus, we found a stray kitten.  I kept it.  In my dorm room.  For a semester. (I took him to the vet, the next day, no worries.)  He then went to live with my parents back in the bay area.

The sauce was excellent, and tasted like it was made of fresh tomatoes. It was almost a tad too cheesy for me, but it was so good overall that it worked out really well.  We also ordered the Chicken Marsala - which for me, I always did not like - and it was REALLY good.

I told her I had written the address I was changing my licence to, and she instructed me to write my currently-registered address, which I did.  A minute after she sent me away, she called me back saying that I gave her the wrong address... Um, right..

And always a crowd favorite, the Cokerell Butterfly center takes you into the rainforest where the butterflies will land on you - perfect for taking beautiful shots of feeding or resting butterflies on gorgeous foliage.\n\nThe Houston Museum of Natural Science is a fabulous way to spend a day out of the weather and into a journey of learning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6u3L5ipl4qelJW0PppJXmg"}

You can come here any time of the day to work, drink tea, catch up with friends, listen to music, or play board games. Other highlights include free WiFi and a variety of seating areas - from cozy floor cushions to spacious wooden and glass tables in the back perfect for working or studying, to small two person tables ideal for catching up with friends. \n\nThe food and teas/coffees are great (and definitely NOT overpriced) and the owners take extra care to make sure everything is perfect. If not (which is very rare), they will often bring a new meal free of charge. The ingredients are fresh and healthy - the owners make most of the food in the kitchen, and gather ingredients from around the world. The food is vegetarian, and while I am not vegetarian, I have loved all of the items so far. Customer service is amazing 5 star - extremely personal and accomodating, all the items are brought right out to your table, often by the owners themselves, inifinitely better than Starbucks or Small World. While some reviewers have complained that the teas take longer to make, that's only because of the care needed to freshly brew certain varieties of tea - if you're in a hurry, just ask which drinks are made faster. The owners are also very welcoming of feedback and actually make changes based on customer suggestions.\n\nIn addition, Infini-T is not just a tea house, they also have many items for sale - Turkish coffee cups, scarves, spices, and other items gathered from around the world. The furniture is also imported from around the world. On many Friday nights, they have live music, making sure to incorporate a range of styles - jazz, country, folk, more exotic styles as well. Recently, they even had a bellydancing show.\n \nEveryone who I have brought to Infini-T has loved it and many have become regulars. I am here several evening per week and highly recommend it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-z9gkmyVklh-FeHNDPXEZw"}

Individual cupcake reviews (I've tried most -of them!) follow.  Note that these are based on my personal tastes (chocolate is better than vanilla, the darker the better, and buttercream frosting is better than cream cheese frosting):  \n\n***Dark Chocolate***: I know it's too rich for some people, but if you love dark chocolate this cupcake is to die for.   Moist dark chocolate cake and rich, bittersweet buttercream frosting.   They use the finest quality chocolate and you can tell.  This is my #1 cupcake of all time, here or anywhere else.\n***Mocha***: A close second to the dark chocolate, this has the same cake as the dark chocolate and a very similar frosting, but it has a mocha flavor as well.  It is powerful but not overwhelming and is really, really excellent as well.\n***Banana***: Another cupcake they do very well.  It is available with vanilla or dark chocolate frosting, and sometimes milk chocolate frosting (off-the-menu).   I obviously prefer it with dark chocolate, but my bf loves the vanilla (it is his favorite Sprinkles cupcake in fact).  The cake is moist and has a nice banana flavor without being too strong.   \n***Milk Chocolate***: These cupcakes have milk chocolate frosting, and either a vanilla cake part (Vanilla Milk Chocolate) or a dark chocolate cake base (Milk Chocolate).  Obviously, I prefer dark over milk chocolate but I think the frosting is still pretty good, although it is cream cheese-based, rather than butter-based, and thus has a different taste.  I also think the dark chocolate cake is moister than the vanilla cake.   \n***Vanilla***: This is vanilla cake with vanilla frosting.   I found this boring and bland (and also think their vanilla cake is too dry).\n***Red Velvet***: Probably their most popular, but I think it is over-hyped.  I am not a huge fan of red velvet cupcakes in general, but I don't like these.  The frosting is ok (considering I'm not a cream cheese frosting person and I like it pretty well, it must be pretty good), but I find the cake part way too oily.   Also the red food coloring they use bleeds all over your hands when you're eating it.\n***Strawberry***: This one is WAY too sweet.   I like strawberries fairly well, but this cupcake just has an incredibly overpowering sweetness that makes it hard to eat.  \n***Cinnamon Sugar***: This \"cupcake\" has no frosting and tastes basically like a muffin.   It is a fairly bland muffin at that (no fruit, no chocolate, etc) and is pretty dry.  It was edible, but not better than a typical grocery store muffin and certainly not worth $3.25\n***Chai Latte***: The cardamom is overpowering.  I like chai tea, but I didn't like this cupcake at all.  Half of it went in the trash.\n***Peanut Butter Chip***: I like the cake part, which has a very mild peanut butter flavor and chocolate chips throughout (even better when slightly melted) and the frosting has a strong peanut flavor, but you get the chocolate flavor from the chocolate sprinkles.  Pretty good.\n***Orange***: I don't eat oranges, but my boyfriend liked it alright.  No raves though.\n***Pumpkin***: Nice, lightly spiced pumpkin cake and cinnamon cream cheese frosting.  The frosting is not my favorite (cream cheese) and is a little too sweet, but its balanced by the pumpkin cupcake.   This is one of my favorite non-chocolate cupcakes.\n***Key Lime*** (seasonal):  I don't like key lime flavor.  My boyfriend liked it reasonably well, but didn't give it any raves.\n***Lemon Blueberry*** (seasonal): We didn't hate it, but given how much we both like blueberries, this cupcake is not the best.\n***Summer Cherry*** (seasonal): I didn't try (I hate cherries) but my boyfriend was not a fan at all, and said this might be the worst Sprinkles cupcake he tried.\n***Raspberry*** (seasonal):  I really hated it, but my boyfriend loved it, so I guess it depends on your raspberry threshold (it is VERY raspberry-ey and also verrryyyy sweet...I thought it tasted like cough medicine).\n***Almond Dark Chocolate***(seasonal): Dark chocolate frosting that I love, of course, but the almond cake is terrible.  I like almonds fairly well, and I don't mind the nuts in the cake even though they are a little soggy.  But they used about 10 times too much almond extract and so the cake has an incredibly overpowering, artificial flavor (and smell!)\n***Flourless Chcolate***(seasonal) They only have this the week of Passover, but it is outstanding.   It tastes much more like a brownie than a normal cupcake and comes with a vanilla glaze instead of frosting, but its really really good.    \n\nI don't recommend the \"minis\" that they've introduced now.  Its a tempting idea - cheaper & a smaller portion size, but they're SO small (one bite, basically) that its hardly worth $2.   They're also a bit drier than the regulars and the frosting is plopped on  & not spread out. \n\n(Best ___: Best Cupcake)", "type": "review", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw"}

I could get the unbleached cheesecloth I wanted but not the empty plastic jars.  The kitchen accessories that I do want are prices at high retail, so I feel vaguely uncomfortable buying them unless they are relatively rare or hard to find.

While Eddie's, as occupied by its latter proprietors, had indecipherable Soviet Post Office Hours, Ginger is pretty much open from a more convenient FiddlerRoofian Sunrise to Sunset, to accomodate ideal rumpus hours across the street at Grant Park. \n\nMy picnic date and I ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich ($7) with arugula, red onion marmalade, and horseradish aioli. The horseradish was mild, and good for those whose palate and disposition are not \"as thick as Tewkesbury Mustard,\" but the sandwich was still very flavorful, as was the marinated veggie with goat cheese sandwich ($6). As side salads, we got the Greek (picnic date thought there was too much raw amino acid sulfoxide-laden onion) and the potato salad (very classic and simple, but good...not too much mayo, but still soft potatoes for the win!). I came back the next day and ordered a cafe mocha, which is made with our native Pasadena delicious Jone's coffee. The owner was so excited about the new shipment of chocolate, and thus my mocha was truly Oompa-loompaesque. (He asked if he put too much chocolate, which is unfortunately a question based on an impossible premise, and I will soon vigorously recommend that he read \"Plato and Platypus Walk Into a Bar.\") I do have perhaps one gripe with the otherwise delicious cafe mocha; in my opinion it wasn't quite warm enough, so increasing the brew temp would be my only suggestion. We partook of the free samples of desserts (a savory cookie with lots of herbs and spices and a flaky pastry with chocolate), and both were delicious.  \n\nThe store is very cute and has old fashioned Hershey bars, soda pop bottles, and various other Ye-Olde-Confectionary-Shoppe style items. They also have a few toys for the kiddos. These are cool, but I do recommend supplying larger and heavier hula hoops, for all but the tiniest of children. This is because (according to a powerpoint I just found on the internet), it's easier to keep the hula going that way: \"The heavy hoop has more rotational energy, so it will be easier to keep moving. The faster the hoop goes!, the more centripetal force...which pushes it up against my body! The more normal force it feels from my body, the more static friction is keeping it from sliding down.\" Basically, what happened was that I told my picnic date I was a world-class hula hooper, and this ended in a major embarrassment. \n\nAnyway, I highly recommend heading to Ginger and having a nice picnic, while ogling at cute basketball players in the courts across the street.

The owners are not Mexican, but it doesn't matter. They do a FAR better job than those clowns over at Tios. I enjoyed my food there very much, their prices are reasonable and they make a delicious Strawberry Daquiri that tastes like strawberry, unlike Tios who served me up lemon sour mix disguised as a Strawberry Daquiri. Loved the chimichanga and chicken tacos...they don't charge you for chips and the chips taste good, not like they were mass produced (ie. the yellow gross ones from tios), they smother your food with cheese and don't charge extra for it, ie. Tios, and the service was great, ie. unlike Tios. The salsa is tasty and the food tasted fresh. There were actually tomatoes and lettuce on my plate, unlike tios. I give this place thumbs up.

Nice folks, terrible breakfast.  Here's why: when I got my taco's they were \"black bean and bacon\" and a \"migas\" taco.  First the black bean taco was boiled black beans (not refried) with no spices loaded on a soggy doughy tortilla with a 1 scant piece of nearly burnt crumbled bacon on top.  The Migas taco was half soggy tortilla chips cooked into eggs with soupy tomatoes and onions, again no flavor.  I think the one spice was paprika for color.  The tomato and onion in the Migas taco seamed pre-cooked as the onion was thin and translucent like from soup and the entire taco tasted like a bland canned stewed tomato + corn chips.\n\nNow, I could understand getting some thrown together food if Arturos was a hotel and food was something the just did on the side.  BUT HOW CAN YOU PUT OUT BAD FOOD WHEN THIS IS ALL YOU DO!  If i seam upset it is because I am.  I grew up in restaurants and worked in them for many years later and I know it isn't hard to make decent food so when I blow $11 on bland tacos and a rare opportunity for a weekday breakfast with my girlfriend its a real let down.  \n\nAurturos here some advice on how to improve your food that is cost effective:\n\nBeans: Since you are making it in large batches, to start roughly and quickly chop equal amount of onion and tomato and toss it in with your beans that you let soak overnight.  Then half that amount of seeded jalape\u00f1os and garlic, then half that amount of a spice blend of equal parts cumin and salt and one cheap beer and one handful of cilantro for every onion you put in.  Bam! Beans with flavor. \n\nBacon, get a big oven tray, lay out thick-cut pieces and stick them in the oven.  This lets them stay plump, cook all the way and get browned without getting small hard and crumbly.  This will also save you tons of labor as you can set a timer and just have one person pop them in and out between doing other work.  If you want to make refried bean (which is the only thing you should be putting on tacos) take the bacon drippings and add them to some beans and blend.  Nothing wasted.\n\nMigas:  NEVER PRECOOK YOUR VEGGIES, prep a mix of seeded and chopped jalape\u00f1os (yes you can get a seeding tool at restaurant supply that lets you do this fast [$5] so no excuses) chopped onion, chopped cilantro, sliced mushroom.

They've got things split up with the Oyster bar on the back end and a full bar upfront. We sat at the Oyster Bar while waiting for a table. Plenty of small plates, oysters and a selection of punches and a few beers at this bar. This side is open air to the patio and is much quieter than the main bar and dining area. I could see myself having a little oyster/beer happy hour here after work.\n\nThe main dining area has an open view of the kitchen and high arch ceilings. I love the open feel and I must mention the mighty comfy looking cushioned bar stools :-) The cocktails I tried were awesome. Gin with celery bitters? OK! And the other gin cocktail with a smoke salmon garnish? Money. I loved them both and think they have a nice selection of uniquer flavors on their cocktail menu. The oysters (while I'm not expert) were absolutely perfect. The clams/pork belly appetizer is very flavorful and has a nice spice to it. Tempura green beans were good as well. \n\nThe service was perfect. The bar tender at the Oyster Bar was very quick to take drink orders and actually explain the difference between the two bars. We were seated right at our reservation time I believe and our waitress was great. It was a full house and certainly busy, but didn't seem frantic at all.

We were waited on promptly though, but then he kind of forgot about us once we got our food (I usually expect at least one \"how is your food?\" check up from the waiter).  I of course had the Buffalo wings with a draft of Old Speckled hen (they also had Brooklyn beer),  while my friends opted for the \"The Heights Wrap\" and \"The Heights Burger\".  Nothing particularly special except that they do have $3 happy hour margaritas.  Just remember that \"there is no happy hour on the roof\".\n\nOh I just remembered that I also had their \"Vancouver Fries\" described as: \"smothered in shredded jack and cheddar\" . They were indeed covered in cheese but were also luke warm and tasted as if they might have microwaved it.\n\nUpdate 7/16/07: I was in the neighborhood and when I decided to give this place a second chance.

We previewed the prix fix menu and thought the offering sounded the best out of any of the local spots that were participating. We even checked the rating on Yelp and came to the conclusion that it would be a good bet we would be treated to an excellent dining experience. With the exception of the dessert (she had the bread pudding and I had the cheesecake) we were severely underwhelmed. We also couldn't get reservations until 9pm. When we got there, the only full tables were the patio seats. Pretty much the whole inside dining room was empty, leading us to believe they had a certain amount of tables set aside for guests of the hotel. Had we been able to get reservations earlier, our experience might have been different.\n\nLet's start with the apps. My greens and smoked salmon was a decent but not fantastic opener. She had the crabcake which was definitely better. The crabcake had enough fresh cooked crabmeat to make it different than the traditional offering, but also had enough flavor to be noteworthy. Smoked salmon is still smoked salmon, even when you add what is supposed to be a bacon seasoning which I didn't taste at all. I guess I was expecting naively that I would be getting something a little more inspired based on the menu description. \n\nFrom there the meal took a severe nose dive. I ordered the lamb shank in a port wine reduction with a side of roasted potatoes. Roasted potatoes are hard to mess up, but HT did. I was given a generous helping of dry and under-seasoned things. The lamb was so drenched in the port wine sauce that it could have been roast pork I was eating and I would not have known the difference. Lamb is one of the more flavorful meats but when you drench it in a sauce that would overpower the flavor of calves liver, you know you have gone down the wrong culinary path. My girlfriend's salmon was dry but tasted decent enough. The flavor wasn't abundant but it was there.\n\nWe finished off with the chocolate bread pudding and the amaretto cheesecake. These desserts were both great and by the second bite, I was thinking that we had just bought $33 desserts. The bread pudding as rich as it was still packed a whole lot of chocolate and banana flavor that would have been finished to the last bite had we been enjoying ourselves more. I really liked the cheesecake as it wasn't too heavy but was creamy and tasty. -I was searching for the amaretto flavor, but decided it was amaretto by default by the top coating of thinly sliced roasted almonds.\n\nOur drinks were also a factor in the rating. I ordered a spicy margarita. Spicy, no. Margarita, maybe. It ended up being a watered down version of a margarita with a hint of tequila and no evidence that the bartender gave consideration to the drink menu. Her mead manhattan sounded good in theory, but really just tasted like a weakened sangria-tini. Oh well, might as well try something new once in a while right? \n\nHenrietta's Table should be fantastic, but if it is we missed it that night (a Tuesday).  Apparently brunch is the recommended time to go, so maybe we went at the wrong time. For the price and the reputation, we expected much more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1iY5q6spBS_DNWyemY829A"}

After completing the series of X-rays, and waiting for their development, the technician re-appeared and told me that I had to have another set of X-Rays taken as a few of the first ones didn't work out (Yay! More exposure to X-Rays!). I have never had this happen with X-rays, ever.\n\nWhen the actual dentist finally appeared after the second set of X-rays and another bit of wait time, she greeted me nicely and appeared to be a very nice and personable woman. At the start of the examination she told me about one \"gap in my teeth\" and asked if I wanted to get it fixed. As it was my first time at this dental practice, I didn't think much of this question and I told her \"no thanks.\" However, throughout the rest of the examination and cleaning she made me feel incredibly self-conscience by repeatedly asking me if I \"wanted to get it fixed,\" and commenting \"I could fix that.\"  This happened at least 5 times, including times while I couldn't even respond while she was working inside my mouth.\n\nTo be clear: In all my 30+ years I have NEVER run into anyone ever commenting or pressuring me to \"fix the gap in my teeth.\" \n\nFor a professional dentist, she was completely unprofessional, clearly lacks social tact, and apparently does not listen to her clients.\n\nThe is the first time in 30+ years that I have ever decided to not return to a dental practice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OgvbKQVIa9roTwN6rDP9yA"}

The downstairs is interesting, but the real goodies are available on the second floor. The first floor highlight, pour moi, was checking out the strange toys and inventions (\"Claude Shannon's Ingenious Machines\") which were alternately delightfully creepy and sweetly precious.\n\nUpstairs, as many have mentioned, were buttloads of robots. Reading the placards next to many of their cases, I was amazed at how many were developed by MIT students at such a young age. It's amazing to think that your senior thesis project might go on to become a viable piece of medical technology that actually helps people, but I digress....\n\nThe holograms on display are awesome. My favorite were the \"moving\" holograms, in which a lady will blow you a kiss and one which shows a red line train eternally pulling into the Charles MGH T-stop sometime in the early 80's. It's pretty freaky to look at  representations of people, like artist Keith Haring, and know that they are now dead, yet have them look so real and so touchable in front of you.\n\nThe absolute best part of the museum was the gallery with Arthur Gascon's \"Gestural Engineering\" : utilitarian, machine-based artwork. I loved the 11 flying pieces of paper that flapped their wings like birds and the violin  whose strings were gently stroked by a feather. It was gorgeous, and better than anything I've seen recently at the ICA.\n\nFinally the \"Mind and Hand: The Making of MIT Scientists and Engineers\" exhibit, featuring academic paraphernalia such as textbooks, school supplies, uniforms and ephemera like dance cards, laundry receipts, and movie tickets dating from 1860 to the present was very touching. It made me wonder about the fates of these students and wonder what they did with all their wonderful potential.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0637qPnv_9upNsjTqA4aYg"}

I spotted the sushi bar about 10 feet from the entrance after walking in, and what's this? $2 off any sushi pack after 7 pm? Yes please! For $4.95 I received a fresh pack of 8 California rolls. A gigantic Caesar's salad and package of grapes later, and we were sitting at $16. Like I said, some things are a good deal and some things are not.\n\nSo, sushi and Twizzlers in hand (post-gym dinner of champions?), we headed home and I must say the sushi was some of the best that I've had in the area.

The fact that I'm giving another coffee place 5 stars (considering the review I wrote for Taste Coffee House) is truly remarkable. Crema Cafe is easily accessible from Harvard Square, and it will quickly become my on-the-way-home-from-work dinner stop.\n\nAs Erica G. said in her review, \"If you are a vegetarian, I highly recommend the sweet potato sandwich.\" On that note, I highly recommend it if you aren't! That delicious concoction of fresh sweet potatoes, sweet green apple slices, avocados, sprouts, and hummus & caramelized shallot vinaigrette is enough to make me want to turn vegetarian... I mean, if that means I can have the Sweet Potato Sandwich every day of my life, then please sign me up. If only I had more room for the homemade sweet potato chips... mmmm.\n\nNow, what sets this place apart is its value. I gave it one $ because it is cheaper than many other coffee places... it's all relative. The large latte is actually the size of a Starbucks grande, but it costs near the amount of a tall; however, it manages to safely combine FOUR shots of espresso into the cup. FOUR. The espresso junkie in me is jumping for joy right now. The espresso has a mildly sweet taste to it, and the ratio of espresso to flavored syrup to milk is done very well, as to compliment the great taste of these four shots without taking away from the authenticity of a latte. While this latte was surprisingly delicious to me, I still think Taste Coffee House beats it out by a smidgen, especially when considering the barista skills of the Taste guys... the latte art and overall taste couldn't quite compare. But, for that price, I'm still pretty shocked... or, maybe I'm just shaky from all that caffeine. Nevertheless, greatness was consumed!\n\nLastly, the sweets... Although I did not subdue my cravings (too full), they looked immaculately incredible. Not to mention the creative recipes and massive cookies for $1.75.\n\nSo, congratulations are in order for Crema Cafe... you've earned my utmost respect and allegiance.

Everyone is so welcoming and even if this faith is new to you, they are there for you.  There is a projection screen with the readings and songs displayed, so you are never lost.  The priests are always available for counsel after mass and they even have a prayer group present on a weekly basis accepting requests.

They offer 2,3,4,5 or 7 pancakes starting at $3.25...This is a great deal for light eaters. They offer two types of potatoes, roasted red potatoes with onion and peppers and good old hash brows, both delicious. They have some amazing looking pancakes with a wide variety of toppings like banana pancakes topped with caramelized bananas and chopped walnuts, cinnamon apples, chopped pecans and brown sugar butter, the \"Tree Huggers\" with granola, fresh fruit with sweet orange butter and the list goes on and on all at about $6.75 for a very large serving....You must try one of their daily specials as well. Today they had crepes stuffed with lemon creme topped with whipped cream!!!!! Yummy!!!  They also offer a build your own omelette and offer egg whites for those who enjoy the yolk-less omelette with all fresh ingredients to choose from starting at $5.25.The atmosphere is a modern decor twist with LA Icons adorned as wallpaper and the place sort of feels as if you are sitting in a MOCA vignette.

I had to ask him who he was. He looked at some discs I had brought for a couple of minutes, then asked me to walk on my heels, walk on my toes, step onto a ledge. He asked what caused (preceded the onset of) my pain and where it was. Then he proceeded to tell me that there was nothing he could do for me. I asked \"But why did they do surgery before?\" (three surgeries for stenosis, on all three levels of spine, two done at Stanford). His answer \"I know nothing about that\" (though he had all my records in front of him). Then I asked him how small my spinal cord had to be before surgery would be done (it is \"severely stenotic\" in several places on MRI, e.g. 5 mm across, and I am essentially unable to stand or walk). He said \"No one will do anything until no 'white area' [spinal cord viewed on MRI] is visible at all. We only operate when the disk is gone and bone rubs on bone.\" (This is not my problem.) He repeated this information, about disks and bone-on-bone, slowly and with exaggerated patience. He told me that what I had, severe stenosis, was a \"just part of aging, like wrinkles.\" Then he mentioned \"You probably have a fracture.\" I asked him what I could do about that and he said \"That's not my problem, is it?\" (Numerous studies and practitioners have viewed my spine in the last two years, and I've heard nothing about a fracture.) At about this point, he picked up his dictation device and, as if to tell us it was over, began dictating in our presence. I listened as long as I could (he misrepresented what I had said, saying I'd sought a diagnosis from \"several doctors,\" which is not true - only one other local neurosurgeon, who suggested I come to Stanford). That was my visit, aside from being sent to X-ray to confirm the fracture. I was left thinking that: every doctor I'd seen (the neurologist who'd done my EMG and told me that \"this will get you surgery,\" the radiologists who'd read my MRIs and X-rays, my primary who referred me to Stanford Neurosurgery, my rheumatologist, and the one other neurosurgeon I'd consulted), were all crazy or incompetent. Plus I would be stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of my life, with severe back and buttock pain, unable to stand. Needless to say, I was devastated. A chaplain named Carol saw my tear-streaked face in the hall and took me aside to counsel with me.

We were rowdy and the conversation was not exactly on the conservative side.  Our main waitress was especially helpful in taking special requests.  One of our friends wanted something \"different,\" so the waitress checked in with the cook and he whipped up some sausage he was working on for the following week's menu.  The waitress was willing to exchange the same friend's drink for something else free of charge because our friend \"didn't like it.\"  And even towards the end of the night when they were starting to clean up, the staff wasn't pushy in trying to get us to leave.\n\n2. The meal.  The best damn snap peas I've ever had, and decent roast chicken to boot.  \n\n3. The drinks.  I noticed that the beer & wine menu was quite varied.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The portion sizes.  They were on the small side.  The $4 side of corn bread that we got was TINY.  And my meal was on the small side for the price.  I suppose that's because one is meant to order four courses or some such, but that just isn't me.  \n\n2. The service.  While the staff themselves were great, it took a while for anyone to take our drink, appetizer and entree orders.  I was a hungry, hungry hippo and they probably didn't bring out the bread till 20 minutes after we got there.  \n\n3. The taste.  While my meal was more than decent, my girlfriend's gnocchi tasted super-artificial.  And my friend's sausage tasted like I could have gotten it at a grocery store.  Which, for the price, shouldn't be the case.\n\n4. The menu.  It was too specialized for my taste.  While they were great about accommodating special dietary needs and substitutions, I had a difficult time finding something I actually liked.  \n\nWe were told that their menu changes weekly, so don't necessarily depend on what you see on the online menu (this per the waitress).

They apologized for the wait because they had to attendt to emergencies - I get that-  then have more people on a shift!  For it to happen every time I've been- eight times-makes me question their credibility.   Yes, this is a harsh review-but as many others have stated-they're all about the money.  My sick cat went in tonight and I was told she needed hospitalization so she could get fluids.  I brought it up that I could -and was willing-to give her the fluids at home-as I had been given that option for another one of my cats from our regular vet.  My experience has been that  VCA always recommends as many tests as they can-where other vets start with basic blood panel and go from there.  Don't get me wrong-the staff and Dr.s are very nice- it's just there is very little common sense utilized in regard to wait time and comfort for our pets. Again-emergencies only!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "7VLl-eRHx7A2fHWOXHPg0Q"}

I was so excited that a shabu place was coming to Harvard. But the fare was so awful that we actually left about three bites into the meal, and I have never done that before. I've eaten shabu many times, most often at spots in Chinatown or Allston/Brighton, so this review is not out of ignorance.\n\nSushi: the salmon sashimi was cut wrong and from the wrong part of the fish. It was mushy, floppy, and had too much of that gray fatty skin on it. \n\nShabu: The meat was awful (chicken dryer and beef way way tougher/chewier than at other shabu spots). The broth was NOT broth, but plain old fatty chicken stock. This gave the veggies and meats a bad flavor. The dab of soy sauce/tsuru was way too salty - it should have been much less salty and served more liberally.  \n\nService: They clearly don't have their game down. The meal came out in fragments - the meat came out about 10 minutes before the veggies, and the \"broth\" had been boiling away for some time when we finally got to start cooking. They gave us a single \"broth\" pot, rather than one with a divider. We asked to switch, and they did so right away. There were more servers than customers, and yet service was still slow, and a bit clumsy. \n\nLayout: The tables don't seem quite big enough for shabu. There were just 2 of us at a table for 4, but the food was cramped and took up the whole table, so we were reaching across the boiling pot and hotplate to reach the meat and veggies. Not sure how it would fit 4 people. \n\nManagement: They were very concerned when we asked for the check, and asked lots of questions. We certainly appreciated the concern, and they actually didn't let us pay though we wanted to. After hearing what we thought was wrong with the meal, they explained it by saying that \"they serve Chinese shabu, this is Thai shabu.\" But given that shabu is Japanese, we weren't really convinced. \n\nGoodness, I hope they get it together. I will be dropping cash here once they do**.\n---\n**Update: I will now be dropping cash at Shabu Ya, the other new shabu shabu joint that just opened up in Harvard Square.

When she moved away and I eventually moved as well, I haven't been able to really find that \"perfect match\"\n\nI went to Amyrose at Peter Thomas whose haircut I loved about 1.5months ago but it was time for that post-highlights trim to remove all the dead ends. I made the mistake of stopping at Maxi Hair on the way home \"just to get a trim.\" \n\nNEVER again.\n\nHannah cut my hair and while it seems that other people on here absolutely loved her cuts, it seems like she has no idea how to cut shorter hair. I have been trying to grow out my hair for a few months and I specifically requested three things:\n\n1) Keep as much length as possible-- i.e. just remove the split ends\n2) I do not like blunt cuts so keep the A-line shape that I already have with a VERY minimal trim. I have a wider, square face and I tend to look like a block on a stick (my neck) when I get blunt cuts. REALLY unflattering.\n3) DON'T touch my bangs because I decided I wanted to grow them back out.\n\nWhat did Hannah do? Take off over 2\" of length all around to give me a blocky, old lady blunt cut and she CUT MY BANGS before I had a chance to even respond. By the time I was able to yell \"stop\" the first chunk had already been shortened and it was too late to fix it. At that point she was like \"oops I already cut them\" and I had to let her even them out unless I wanted to go home with one section of bangs that was obviously shorter than the rest.\n\nWhile the layers and the rest of the cut was fine, it was clear that the comprehension wasn't there-- what about \"don't touch the bangs and don't give me a blunt cut\" is so hard for a stylist to understand?!\n\nJust to add insult to injury, after being told on the phone that there was a student discount of $5 for a haircut, I was told in person at the cash register that they don't honor student discounts for a haircut with Hannah! I also was told over the phone that blow dry is an extra $5 but I ended up being charged $10 at the counter.\n\nIn addition, after I was steaming about the lack of listening, the other lady at the counter had the nerve to ask me if I needed an eyebrow wax (while giving me the look that implies that she thinks I needed one) and if I was ever planning on fixing my roots.\n\nThat being said, if you've had your hair cut here before and you know and trust someone here, kudos to you, but as for me, I'll pay the extra $5-10 to go somewhere else. Yes, a $35 haircut is pretty moderately priced, but it's $35 too much for my current haircut. I wish I could reverse time a full 2 hours.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4lPpcPrYGS-jrOhJSTFu7A"}

I had eyed Rangzen on my visits to the Cambridge Public Library, and have been very curious what Tibetan food would be like ever since. They seated us after just 5 minutes. Win!\n\nWell, this particular Tibetan food was... OK. Just OK. I'd give it 2.5 stars. For starters, we shared two types of bread. One was plain with just a little butter, and the other, superior, looked more like a wrap - vegetables baked into the crepe-like outside and wrapped around other veggies. As for my entree, I got a beef entree. It was shreded beef and mushrooms over bean noodles with tomatoes and potatoes and garlic. My biggest complaint is that the sauce was just very very thin - it was like an oily/watery tomato sauce. The very thin, small noodles got lost in the mix. I tried my boyfriend's chicken steamed dumplings, and these were alright, but they were very basic, and didn't go that well with the sauce they came with. \n\nSo yeah, that's nice that this restaurant is not too busy for walk-ins on 8:30 on a weekend night, but then again, I may not be going down this side street again except to pick up the latest best sellers.\n\nPS: The other couple I dined with got 2 cups of Poecha tea, the traditional butter tea of the region.

Hollanders blew me away with their selection, quality and service. \n\nI just went over there for the first time during Ann Arbor's Midnight Madness.  This was my first trip there and I spent so much time there I think I was in there for 45 minutes to an hour. In a paper store?- seriously I was. \n\nSUMPTUOUS PAPER\nYou just want to reach out and touch, rub, feel the papers, as some of them look silky and alive (but I kept my hands off so as to not ruin the papers).  It's an explosion of design for the senses.  Some of their paper looks like you could take it off the rack and begin sewing with it, it's that beautiful. \n\nTIP OF THE CARDSTOCK\nPaper is just one item at Hollanders though, as they have many gifts, stationaries, cards, journals, etc. to choose from and upstairs is an entirely different store- high-end housewares. \n\nYou will have to walk through many many times to take it all in as they have quite a bit of space compared to many of the small Kerrytown retailer spaces.  The selection is vast, so you'll need time to take it all in.  *Hollanders is an experience.*  You don't just dash and grab like you're at Walgreens, so plan on spending time there and enjoy the experience.\n\nBRING OUT THE ARTIST IN YOU\nEven if you're not an artistic, crafty type of person, one trip to Hollanders might make you want to take up some type of artistic hobby and run with it.  The blank card stock and stationary selections also might make you ditch the constant emailing and opt to put pen to paper- takin' it back to old school. \n\nIN SUMMARY\nIf you ever saw \"The Sound of Music\" (who hasn't?) and gotten all  crazed when Julie Andrews sang the line \"The Hills are alive with the sound of music...\", then you just might go into Hollanders and have the same experience she had- but from paper.

How can I not be alright with that? exactly. \n\nBefore going further into this I should mention that I'm not huge into a lot of comics, but when I saw Homer Simpson's fleshy figure through the windows at Vault 'o Midnight, I was drawn to VoM like a Bender to a beer. I guess if I had to pinpoint what I'm most into about comics, it would be the characters... specifically the ones with animal-like features, or elephantiasis-like body parts... I'm talkin' jugs and junk, yo. I know it's not real, but I still can't help but stare. \n\nAnyway, I'd say I'm somewhat of a comic novice, though I did have some formal comic education (no really) while in college when I took a semester's worth of 'Development of Comics in World Societies' circa 2003/2004. So yeah, you could say I've been keepin' it pretty real in the un-real world. Plus, I like to shop around for new looks in CBs. Some people look to Elle or GQ or Glamour, I look to ThunderCats and X-Men... okay, Pinterest helps too. \n\nEntering Vault of Midnight, two major things stood out to me as opposed to some of the other comic stores I've visited. A. It is the cleanest, most modern best organized shop I have ever been in. And B. (and I'm just gonna lay this all out there) It has, hands down, the most attractive employees. These nerds are burnin' up folks... and they're not just comic eye-candy, these cats got mad knowledge on all things cartoonin'. \n\nWith a little bit of everything, I think we can all agree that their strong suit are the actual bound paper-print comics. With 2 floors, the basement of which being a masterfully cataloged selection from what seemed like every genre, era, etc. They had collectables, a few figurines, signed posters, tiny toys, and ever-changing and up-to-date display featurettes highlighting a certain artist or style- at the time of my visit it was dedicated to Will Eisner, the works of, inspired by, biographies, etc. Just a really immaculate way to present a topic. \n\nWhen back in the area, this is a store I think I'll always have on my 'to-do' agenda, and somewhere I highly recommend adding to your repertoire as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PkMZ4hFtvD1oybxsPgzlVQ"}

They offer 13 FREE Tuesdays a year, check out their site for exact free Tuesday dates. They have daily tours and animal meet and greet, which are great for your visit. \n\nThe new dinosaur hall is just amazing! Thomas the T. Rex captured my attention, it is one of the ten most complete T.Rex specimens on earth. They brought ancient animals to life! You can find out everything and anything you want to know about dinosaurs! Huge hall with 2 stories, you can have a very good view of the entire dinosaur hall upstairs. We are very into dinosaurs so we spent most of our time there, lots of questions were answered. The T. Rex growth series, how old are those dinosaurs, how the archeologists brought them to life, where they were found...very educational, and sooo cool! They have lots of other exhibitions too,  mammal halls, birds, insect halls, gemstone vault, archeological treasure, California history....etc, depends on what you like, you can spend more time there, I think it is gonna take a whole day to visit every hall thoroughly, it's just too much walking for me. \n\nThey have a cafe downstairs, good selection of food, snacks, healthy snacks, drinks, sandwich, burger... lots to choose from. It was great to sit down and have some food n beverages to recharge energy, we needed that for the visit! \n\nDon't forget to visit the museum stores, there are so many cute things, we got a few goodies at dinosaur store. :)\n\nThe staffs were very friendly and helpful. It was packed on a holiday Monday, lots of kids, family and couples. Great place for a family day, or date day, fun and educational!\n\nThey are currently doing many constructions both inside and outside, with that 13 million donation, they are gonna have lots of new things coming to this museum!

As odd as it may sound, I highly recommend the BBQ duck, it is phenomenal. The homemade jalape\u00f1o bread and cold beer is a perfect way to compliment the great meat. \n\nAlthough many Texans may scoff at the idea of BBQ sauce, Goode co truly makes some of the best sauce around. You know it's good when vegetarians are warned that the sauce contains beef bits. I even had bottles of the sauce sent to me one year when I was studying in Europe (the most expensive sauce ever after transatlantic shipping!)\n\nThe sides are good as well. I tend the order the jambalaya.  I've never been a fan of beans or potato salad of any sort, so I can offer no judgement here. \n\nBefore you leave, be sure to grab some pecan pie, it's legendary in Houston. \n\nOverall, Goode Company has been one of my favorites and I would certainly recommend it to anyone searching for a good meal. \n\n(Folks from Lockhart are excluded from this recommendation as the notion of BBQ sauce is blasphemous to you)", "type": "review", "business_id": "F-CnLwWvidsZqR9pLUrcBw"}

Another problem is simply that the doctors really don't care from what I have seen. Finally even making an appointment can take forever, since no one answers the phone and the drop in advise nurse always takes a while. All of this could have been forgiven however, if it wasn't for my particularly bad experience this last week.\n\nI have a nasal infection. A bacterial nasal infection. Right now I have had it for over 3 weeks and have been to the Tang Center 4 times and they still won't concede its anything but  a minor cold. I made an appointment, doctor said I should rest and it should go away. Saw an advice nurse, twice! She said it was probably allergies. I told her I have every single symtom of a nasal infection and that I need amoxicillin, she said im not a doctor. Go to the ER since its been over three weeks, i am incredible congested, have a constant headache, and I am going home to see my family and my father recently recovered from cancer (thus has a extremely vunerable immune system) and didn't want to infect him, wait for over 2 hours, and all the advice nurse said was that i need to take sudafed and rest. I tell her thats all ive been doing, may i see a doctor, and she says i shouldn't go to the ER for minor colds, and that it would be over in a day or 2. now my whole family is sick, its been over 3 weeks, and I am still feeling miserable with midterms right around the corner. the tang center is terrible, sorry for the rant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E8SD5aD563JK0Qrd9elvDA"}

The theatre is this neat Tudor building with lots of brick and dark wood inside, which really makes you feel like you're taking a trip back in time, or at least across the Atlantic to a cozy pub/playhouse. I appreciate their traditionalist approach to Shakespeare, using Elizabethan costumes and music to help tell the story. They went to a lot of effort to make the play accessible and enjoyable for everyone, even people who haven't studied Shakespeare and who aren't quite able to follow the language. Midsummer had lots of physical comedy and some fun fairy special effects.\n\nThey offer $2.50 pints of Guinness, Bass, Newcastle, Strongbow and Sweetwater IPA on Friday nights, and they will make you black and tans for an extra English tavern treat. Food was decent -- chips and guac appetizer comes with an impressive mountain of tasty dip. Everything's pre-made and warmed up for you, or in the case of my veggie sandwich, delivered to your plate still wrapped in cellophane. But the prices were reasonable -- we spent around $30 for beers, an appetizer, and two entrees.\n\nWe came on half price ticket night, and I'm not sure if I'm anxious to pay full price to come back. Maybe I'm too much of a snob to get into slapstick, and maybe they take a different tack with other plays, but while I had a good time, this place didn't leave me feeling like I'd had a great night-at-the-theatre experience.

Our usual Brunch place is at Veggie Planet in Harvard Square, but after finding out that HT offers local, organic products (so does veggie planet) I thought it best to give it a try. \nOut experience was very comfortable. We arrived around 10:20 (we did cut it a little close, breakfast ends at 10:30 and they close the kitchen to prepare for the Brunch buffet at noon) The hostess was very nice and allowed us to sit and eat even though it was past 10:30 by the time we were being seated. There were about 4 parties in front of us and the line went quickly.\nWhen we sat we were greeted by our server within a few minutes and offered hot coffe or freshly squeeze orange juice (It was amazing! ). Within 5 mintues we ordered the fruit plate (9$) and each an omlette (9$ each)\nOur fruit plate came out quickly. It was nicely arranged: pineapple, concord grapes, grape fruit, oranges, melon (2 kinds), strawberries, blueberries and a few others. Everything looked beautiful! Each bite was favorful and fresh. I have never tasted a fruit plate like that. Each fruit tasted just like it should, everything was perfectly ripe. \nAfter enjoying our fresh fruit out omlettes came out. They were very large, fluffy, and moist. I belive they were cooked in the oven, which I've never tried. Very tasty! The cheese was fresh, the veggies were abundent! At least 2 oz of spinch in each! The hasbrowns/homefries were to die for! Part buttery, with a crispy bottom. My boyfriend got a tasty peice of fresh pumpkin bread that had butter on the side. I opted for a grilled english muffin, not greasy at all, a perfect crunch to each peice. There was 3 kinds of fresh perserves offered on the table, but we were so excited we forgot to try them. Our waiter did tend to dissapear for a bit, we waited for our check for about 10 mintues. Someone else brought out our food.

The meat momo is full of \"meat\" (they don't say, but I think it was pork and/or lamb), vegetables, and some low-key spices.  Were the momos any good?  Sort of: the flavors were on the mild side, but the dish was reasonably satisfying.

As far as teriyaki joint salads go, it was pretty good.\n\nTokyo Garden doesn't have any windows in the main restaurant area.  The mirrors try to make up for this, but the end result is decidedly cave-like.  That being said, it isn't as though anyone goes to the Ave looking for ambiance.

The Noodle Planet Pho was an interesting take on pho, but it was soo full of msg I had to drink three glasses of water from being so thirsty. The place is cheap so I understand why people come here and they are open pretty late. Perfect for us college kids, but the food is lacking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "P_7A5Ztw4Pwizpdqfx-G-Q"}

The food is not bad, but is absolutely not worth the lines, crowds, and generally unclean, dingy environment.\n\nI have been here twice (I don't know why I went back the second time) and both times I have had to sit near a large table full of at least 15 tweens who were loud and obnoxious.  Loud and obnoxious is basically the environment at this restaurant.  \n\nI have never had the urge to drop a $20 on the table to cover drinks and just walk out of a restaurant until my second trip to this dump.  My party of four had to sit at a table near the sauce station.  The extremely slow moving line and traffic from the sauce station basically had our dirty table surrounded by people on both sides.  It just isn't pleasant to try and eat with your face sitting at butt-level with a bunch of people who for some reason find the lines and crowds acceptable.  \n\nOn this same trip we decided to leave after having a salad.  The line was just horrendous.  The salad items are the same items you put in your food -- so I sat about 5 minutes waiting to get to the cucumbers -- which were just five feed down the line from where I was standing.  After that wait, and seeing the line grow just to get to the first stage of items to put in our bowls, we decided it wasn't worth the wait.\n\nI am not typically picky about food or the atmosphere of restaurants.  But I will never go to this place again and I encourage you to not go to this restaurant.  If you are a tween going out with 20 of your best seventh grade friends, then have at it.  If you are above the age of 18 you will probably not enjoy your time here, especially if it is busy.  The layout of the restaurant is just not designed for the kind of crowds that come here on a weekend night. \n\nI have been to a number of Mongolian barbeque style restaurants, but none as bad as this.  You have to wait in line to get in, wait in line to fill your bowl with food, and then continue to wait in line to get a spot at the grill so somebody can cook it in front of you while you stand around and wait.  \n\nPlease do all of us a favor and don't give this place any more business.

Here's my visit. \n\nAmbiance: I learned from my future sister-in-law that the restaurant is owned by members of a local Reggae band and so hearing reggae music being played all night and seeing colorful artwork and tables throughout the place didn't throw me off. Yes, the decor and feeling of the place didn't really fit with the more upscale food and plates they are trying to produce, but it was relaxing enough and I didn't mind the contrast. \n\nService: There was one bar tender and one server. Both did their jobs and payed enough attention to the house and their guests. There were a few times I wanted more water or a drink refill or dirty dishes cleared but for the most part our server was fine. \n\nFood: I'm quite surprised with a lot of the negative reviews written about the food. Most low star entries talk about the blandness of the food and I found that to be far from the truth.\n\nKangeroo dip: Cheesy, gooey, creamy, delicious dip accompenied by well seasoned what seemd to be homemade tortilla chips. The portion is a humble one so our table of five could have used a second round but it nonetheless was a nice start to our meal.\n\nBasket O' Fries: Double fried french fries with three dips to choose from. An obvious nod to Belgian style fries and I was very happy with them. Even though I thought the ingredients listed in the description came already on top of the fries, I had fun alternating between the tasty side dips and enjoyed the texture of the somewhat smoky tasting fresh cut fries. Good stuff. The curry dip was my favorite but the chil mayo and garlic aioli were nice as well.\n\nBuffalo Whole Chicken Wings with Blue Cheese: A good wing with a good blue cheese for dipping. Not reinventing the wheel here. Just a nice buffalo wing. They do give you the whole wing so some tearing and pulling is called for which I'm not a fan of but not a big deal and nothing that will ruin the dish.\n\nBaltimore Whole Chicken Wings with Ranch: This wing was different and delicious. The old bay seasoning was all over the chicken giving it a dry rub texture and feel. The taste is tangy with a little kick that goes great with the juicy chicken and creamy ranch. A delicious treat. This is the type of wing to get and I will certainly be getting them again in the future.\n\nBeet and Goat Cheese Flat Bread PIzza: Didn't have a bite of this one but my wife enjoyed it so much she didn't even offer.\n\nFish & Chips: Took a bite of my brother-in-law's fish and it was nice. Good texture and flavor. The fish is a whole fillet on the plate so the presentation was impressive. Not sure if I would personally spend $17.50 for fried fish not mattering the quality though.\n\nDrinks: Their drink list is impressive and shows off a lot of local beer but also beers from micro brews around the country. My first drink was Ithaca Beer Co.'s Cascazilla. A real nice hearty, sort of sweet, hoppy red ale. Several levels of flavor and it helped me forget the poor showings from Scale House I experienced the day before. For my second drink I wanted the Mad Elf but much like any restaurant with a large drink list there is a high chance things may be sold out and that was the case with this one. Instead I followed my Northwest roots and got a Red Hook Wit. A belgian style beer that was light and refreshing with hints of ginger. It was very tasty and I also liked the more stout looking bottle the beer came in. It's nice to see Seattle being represented in the beer list and Northstar choose a good one to do so. \n\nLast thoughts: Really this place is a winner. With great food and good drinks there's little I would want more. Sure the feel of the place is somewhat off and the service wasn't spectacular but that can't stop the fact that I enjoyed myself very much and would for certain would come back here. I'm already planning on treating my brother-in-law and his fiancee to a Northstar meal the next time I'm back in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "k9UObyytIt6xmo-vzdpPdg"}

I know that this is part of the whole Rocky experience, but sometimes, I a girl just wants to be warm.\n\nPros:\n- Close to things, like CVS, to buy candy and other reasonably priced movie snacks.\n- Attentive staff. A couple sat in the back row of a theater I was in and were making ridiculous amounts of noise. Stomping and jiggling their feet so that I (sitting rows and rows in front of them) could feel it through the floor., talking loudly, snorting/hacking, yelling at each other, etc. The person sitting directly behind me got an attendant to alleviate the situation. The attendant came in, escorted the couple out when they threatened him, and made for a much more satisfactory experience.

EyeQ got two visits out of me. I saw Dr. David Luria during both trips.\n\nBack in 2004 I was an contact-lens-only wearer. Things went well - appointment, exam, payment. If you wear contacts, you know that in order to purchase lenses with other vendors, you have to submit numbers like lens power, base curve, etc. As I paid, I noticed that the numbers were different on two separate documents they handed me - both written by Dr. Luria. I pointed this out, and one of them said:\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about it -- here I'll just fix that,\" \n\nand randomly grabbed one form to change the numbers to match. To this day I don't know if he picked the right one. No one called for Dr. Luria; didn't seem like they cared, either. \n\nIn 2007, I returned, after trying a couple of other doctors in the area and not feeling the right vibe. Despite the above, I remembered that the EyeQ guys were extremely nice, so I decided to give them another try. I had also finally decided to get a pair of glasses, and these folks were notorious for having interesting frames that didn't make you look like a Level 56 Nerd. So I walked in on the day of my appointment:\n\nCounter folks: \".... hug everyone!\"\nMe: \"Mm? You guys giving out free hugs?\"\nCounter folk: \"Um. SURE!\"\n*HUGS*\n\nSo by now I was thinking, aw, I'm home. I then said, \"I'm looking for glasses that, how do I say this, uh, NOT make me look even more Asian.\"\n\nAnd they totally got it. So some pairs were tried and I found my glasses, which I like (don't love - but like enough to wear, which is quite an accomplishment) to this day.\n\nGoing well so far! Next: appointment w/ Dr. Luria. He performed a few tests, and said he would like a follow-up test in a couple of weeks, that he was concerned about one of the test results. We scheduled that. \n\nTwo weeks later, we did the test again. \n\n\"Looks great! Results are much better. There is one more thing,\" and he went to put some eye drops in my eyes for reasons I can't recall. At which point he stopped short and said, looking a bit startled,\n\n\"Oh. Did you have contact lenses in during that whole test?\" (The test two weeks ago was sans lenses. I considered bringing this up, but decided he was going to be staring at my eyeballs all through that test, therefore would see them, and deduced he wanted them to stay in.)\n\n\"Um, yes.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well, we should have taken them out for the test.\"\n\nNo mention of re-testing. I was given the eye drops, sent home. I never went back. \n\nSo, here's an OPTOMETRIST who FAILED TO SEE THAT I'M WEARING CONTACT LENSES THROUGH AN EYE EXAM. I don't even have a good metaphor for this to try and be funny about it. (Mechanic not seeing the car cover? Designer wondering why clothing fits funny when the model is already dressed?)\n\nEyeQ, you're hip and cool, your glasses are stylish, but you know, stylish glasses do jack sh-t if your eye exams FAIL. For those of you who took the time to read this mess of a post, I recommend using these guys as a frames shop only, for the sake of your vision. \n\n5 Stars for friendliness/great products, minus 3 for er.. failed optometricising.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BwLLHXbY-prFpdNfQs5nqg"}

The food does remind me of cafeteria food, that is somewhat more inspired than say, a hospital.  The food is over-priced and does  not deliver.  I ordered a grilled crispy chicken salad that was supposed to come with butter lettuce, radicchio and blue cheese dressing, and bacon, in that order.  The radicchio was very much predominant, which made the whole thing very bitter and I was actually unable to eat it.  The blue cheese dressing was more aptly blue-cheese flavored dressing, at a stretch, since it was the consistency of non-fat milk, and there was not a speck of blue cheese to actually be seen, let alone a chunk.  It tasted like watered-down Wish Bone from a bottle.  When I told the waitress that the salad was actually awful, she argued, telling me that \"some people like it.\"  After she realized that I was not going to eat it, she offered to replace the radicchio with butter lettuce.  I should have held on to the chicken, which did initially live up to the description, crispy, thin sliced breast meat.  On the return, the chicken was underdone, in some places pink, so it was slimy.  \n\nMy son's meal, a vegetarian dish was as he described it, reminiscent of a cafeteria.  Or something that his roommate might have thought of and made as a thoughtful gesture.  The predominant ingredient was tofu, which was cooked to a rubbery consistency, so that it was difficult to cut or otherwise consume.  It was a large cube.  My husband's hamburger was ok, but when we got the bill, it was nearly $100 for what was essentially snack food for three, no real entree with say a large cut of meat to justify that tab.  Our drinks were not to blame, two of us had house mineral water, and the third, a single beer.  \n\nIn terms of the atmosphere, it was very noisy.  Had I not known better, I might have thought that we stumbled into a party for some toddlers.  We were seated in what I called the kid section, the location in front of the kitchen where there are long tables, that were full of young, unhappy diners.  My guess is that they did not like the food either.  I have no problem with kids, but apparently Friday night is the night to go out with the family in Palo Alto. \n\nFinally, about the service, the waiters are friendly, though largely unskilled.  An example, all the appetizer plates were cleared before the duck dumplings were gone, and we had to protest that being taken away.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nzn4B6Y-Rj2QOhSe7UTMzw"}

I've been craving it since!\n\nCame here for a late dinner on a Tuesday night. I love vegan food, but there was something a little bit off about the food here - it felt kind of bland and uninspired, even though tastewise, the food was decent. The portions are very generous but the food is just kind of boring (albeit filling). \n\nThe chopped vegetable salad falls into this boring category... it was fresh and healthy but just had chopped carrots, peas, peppers, and tomatoes. At least the avocado was somewhat redemptive.\n\nThe TV dinner is an attempt at comfort food - the whole dish looked pretty unappetizing, and though the tempeh loaf turned out to be pretty tasty, it wasn't particularly impressive.\n\nIf anything, the macro plate / real food bargain was probably the best dish, and I would definitely order it again. It's a HUGE portion of food that could be split between two not-totally-starving people. It includes a pretty decent vegetable miso soup, corn bread with tahini miso spread (the cornbread was hearty but a bit on the drier side - also different from conventional cornbread in that it's made of brown rice), as well as a huge plate brown rice, arame seaweed (so good), steamed veggies (boring but then again they're veggies), garbanzo beans, a delicious cabbage salad (somewhere between cole slaw and sauerkraut), and pickled beets! A lot of good flavors, a lot of healthy ingredients, and more than enough food to go around! I did like that there were so many choices for dressings and ALL of them were very good (I liked the cilantro lime and the Thai peanut a lot). \n\nThe service was a bit slow and disorganized, but at least our waitress was nice and acommodating. Given the number of vegan-friendly places in LA, I'm not sure I would come here again, but the food was pretty decent and fresh. Conclusion: this place is good for a healthy and clean meal, but it might not blow your socks off. If you go, get the Real Food Bargain and the lemonade!\n\n(On a side note, we had a strange experience while dining - three elderly people seated nearby us came to our table, started commenting on our food, and then asked if they could take pictures of our food... we said yes, mainly because it would have been difficult to say no - but it was strange and a bit annoying to say the least!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "ogFn9-iNXcJ4yFiN5ZsPow"}

I don't get why people say Ikea stuff won't look good in suburban homes. Just cause you live in the burbs dont mean you have to buy from Pier 1.\n* Those dolly cart things are fun to ride on.\n\nCONS\n* Very crowded.\n* Everyone and their gramma will own the same stuff you do.\n* Terrible for people who have no patience and hate putting things together.\n* It's very DYI. You see what you like, you find it in the warehouse, you ring yourself up, you haul it home. The staff will help out with stock questions but that's probably about it.\n\nTHINGS WORTH BUYING\n* Desks. They have a variety of table tops and legs that you can mix & match.\n* Storage units. Cute tin canisters and plastic container that are just as nice as the Container store but way cheaper.\n* Textiles. They have nice modern prints and curtains that are affordable.\n* Plants and pots. \n* Lighting.\n* Rugs. We found a nice neutral-colored one with nice texture for $150. But not all of it is nice.\n* Sheets, duvet sets. \n* All their kids stuff is cute\n* Kitchen stuff. My friend redid her kitchen and got the cabinet units from Ikea. It looks fabulous.\n\nTHINGS NOT WORTH BUYING\n* Couches, some chairs.\n* Bookcases. If you have a lot of heavy books, the cases will sag.\n* Mattresses. Not comfortable.\n* Blankets, pillows. Overpriced. Go to Home Goods. Their decorative pillows however, are not bad.\n* Art section. Sure generic furniture is ok but art is one thing you should be selective about.\n\nTIPS\n* A trip to Ikea is never an in an' out experience. Be prepared to walk, even if you just go to the market place floor and not the showrooms.\n* It's more fun going with other people. You never know when you'll need someone else to help lift things. \n* In an effort to cut down on using paper/plastic bags, they will charge you 5 cents for bags. So either bring your own or be prepared to lug your shit in your hands. Again, having a friend is a good idea.\n* Having a big car is recommended. Otherwise they have twine so you can strap things to the trunk or roof. Master Boy Scout knot-tying techniques.\n* Go online, if you see things you like, check the stock at the Altanta store BEFORE you go. Sometimes I call the store to make sure.\n* Check out their \"as is\" section near the checkout. It's mostly crap but once in a blue moon they do have bargains.\n* Check Craigslist often, because people are always putting Ikea stuff on sale there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eKSSsmq0JKOtxYHcCEeGAg"}

It's written all over their menu.  Now I'm not really sure what it says, cause I can't read Asian, but people in the know have informed me that it's all just a big ruse.  Let me explain:\n\nWhile the Russians and United States poured all their resources into their nuclear and space programs in the 60's, Chinese scientists were hard at work developing and perfecting the greatest meat subsitute the world has ever known - Protein 2000 (the name of which, while dated now, probably sounded much cooler in the 60's...).  So while your parents were dropping LSD, they toiled away creating the fried vegetable protein that we know today.  But it wasn't until well into the 70's that they added the P2000 sauce, which it turns out is a by-product that resulted from one of the Chinese nuclear-physicists trying to synthesize liquid awesome.  \n\nThis all remained a big secret throughout the 80's, until one of the leading scientists on the project (and founding proprietor of Veggie Heaven) fled China to Texas with the schematics in hand, but not before changing the originals so that the P2000 secret would be lost to the Chinese forever.  Now the Chinese didn't like losing decades and billions of dollars worth of research, but what were they going to do?  Invade Texas?  However, in recent years, there have been talks of extradition, so the people at Veggie Heaven work hard to make sure that anti-Chinese-government sentiment remains high.\n\nBefore that comes to a head, I highly recommend that get your ass to The VH and try this stuff over a bed of rice and broccoli.

The verdict: this place is f@cking awesome. In short: top quality instruction with dedicated classes in boxing, kickboxing, grappling, MMA, wrestling, and strength & conditioning; a great environment and convenient location; and highly competitive rates.  \n\nThe Redline instructors have an unbelievable amount of knowledge and experience, some with professional records that are so impressive they would be almost unbelievable if you haven't witnessed their skills in person. (check out their bio's on the website) But records alone do not make a good teacher, and fortunately, the staff at Redline are amazing instructors as well.  \n\nOne thing you definitely won't find at other gyms is the instruction in the Chinese styles of San Da and Shuai Jiao. The former is a kickboxing style that, despite being relatively unknown in America, is particularly well suited to MMA in part due to its inclusion of take-downs. The MMA instructors at Redline also integrate Shuai Jiao techniques with more traditional Brazilian Jiujitsu moves, resulting in a holistic grappling style that is not only better suited to the 'ground and pound' reality of MMA, but one that can also catch BJJ practitioners off guard in grappling tournaments.  \n\nThe gym is ego-free and even the most talented fighters and teachers are very humble. The atmosphere is respectful and collaborative, with more experienced students offering advice and tips, and everyone is open to try new ideas. Importantly, the facilities are super clean and there are also plenty of changing rooms and showers - not to mention weights, cardio equipment, heavy bags, and a boxing ring (and soon a partial cage).  Whether you're just looking to get in shape, or you're interested in fighting competitively, Redline is hands-down one of the best gyms in the area, and I would encourage anyone who is interested to come in for a trial class.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6EB64SrQIE-QZx_kZN_1jQ"}

I stayed here recently for a friend's wedding and was extremely pleased with my stay.  The decor is beautiful (in particular, I compared it with the Hyatt Santa Clara, where i also stayed recently, and which has much more dated decor), and their Heavenly beds are, yes, heavenly.  I normally hate hotel beds, but I slept like a baby at the Westin (though that could've been due to the copious number of gin and tonics I had at the wedding reception).  The rooms are sizeable, and the bathrooms are *amazing*.  The shower has dual heads, and the bathtub is detached, like some sort of class-ay master bath or what have you.  My only complaint (and reason for the one star deduction) was that it took about 10 minutes for the water in the shower to warm up to a suitable temperature.  However, my friends who stayed in a different room had no problem with their shower, so it was probably just the pipes in my room.\n\nThe pool area, as others have mentioned, is quite small, so don't expect to get your lap swimming in.  I didn't go for a dip, but my friends did enjoy the hot tub.  We also liked the nearby bar/lounge area, where we spent a significant amount of time lying around on couches and chatting.\n\nThe location of the hotel is prime -- just a few minutes walk from the Caltrain, downtown Palo Alto, and a huge upscale mall.  It was super easy to grab some local eats -- and for my friend to buy slacks when he realized that he forgot to bring his suit!  (The mall was so close that he managed to run there, buy pants, and make it to the wedding ceremony before anyone else showed up.)\n\nRunners will be happy to know that Westin has teamed up with Runner's World to provide a map of trails around some of their hotel locations.  The front desk gave me a small playing card-sized map of 3-mile and 5-mile trails circling Stanford University, which I happily used for my Saturday morning long run.  I had a great run and a great weekend, and I'd definitely stay here the next time I have reason to be in the peninsula area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kYZQy3PC3E0evgQBrGnbQQ"}

Last time I went there it was beef, chicken, sausage, and something seafood (forgot what)... but no sliced pork?! \n\nRegardless I've always been pleased with the dishes I've made. :)\n\nThe other thing I like less about TRCB is the wait time. The lines can seriously be 20 minutes or more just to get your food to the cook, then you add in the time waiting. \n\nIts a reasonably cheap meal, always exactly what you wanted, and free valet parking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3ejW1TGlpSVhaspKversrw"}

My salad (chicken, mixed greens, etc...) was quite tasty, but my friend's caprese was amazing!

Our food arrived promptly, our glasses were always filled, and she kept those lemons coming! \n\nPrice: Not bad, especially for the size of the single salad. The pizza is a bit bigger than a personal pizza, so the $12 price is not really high.\n\nAmbiance: A bit noisy and busy, so not really a \"date\" place.

And after many months of anticipation and a perfect afternoon at Lacy Park, I knew the time was right.  Not only that, but the 15 minute parking spot right in front of THE FACTORY was open.  We were meant to be.\n\nSince it was during the week and still relatively early, the selection was amazing.  I picked up a mixed berry and peach cobbler.  I tried the peach first because I don't like peach.  Why did I buy peach if I don't like it?  I thought it would change me... but it didn't.  The peach cobbler was just \"eh\" but I would say that about anything containing peaches so don't trust me.  On the other hand, I spend more time craving berry cobbler than I sleep so I know a good one when I taste it.  It was mind-blowing!  I took a single bite then scurried home and threw it in the oven (350, covered in foil for about 10 minutes) and then slathered it with plenty of vanilla ice cream.  The tartness of the berries combined with the sweetness of the ice cream was pure bliss.  I would have eaten the whole thing if someone wasn't watching me...\n\nDid I mention that the young woman who helped me was wonderful?  I didn't... but she was.\n\nUpdate: My boything went to GCF to get me a cobbler surprise and showed up with one blueberry and one mixed berry cobbler.  Thank you and I love you for that.  Both were sickly delicious, as expected.  Also, he's 6'7 and he told me the woman working called him \"Shorty\" multiple times.  Hilarious.  This place could only get better if I lived there.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to note earlier that all of the cobblers are made with fresh fruit and no preservatives.  Also, on my most recent visit, I ordered a 8x10\" mixed berry cobbler (feeds 6-8) for $25.  You give them the time you'd like to pick it up and they have your piping hot cobbler read for you.\n\nUpdate again:  So GCF called me to tell me my cobbler would be an hour late.   I came in an hour later and it still wasn't ready.  They were very nice and apologized in the form of one free small order of gumbo which I thought was really nice!  The gumbo, however, had FOUR chicken bone fragments, a shrimp with a tail still on, and crab shell fragments, too.  So I had no choice but to take away one star.  I would have taken away 3 if I had paid for the gumbo...", "type": "review", "business_id": "k_NfezjXaXsTkKpmD0xcxQ"}

The price is right too...at $7.50, it's certainly not cheap, but its a fair price for the quality. I would even argue that the Shakedown burger is better than the famous Back Abbey burger in the Claremont Village. \n\nI've also tried the Ganache bomb...at $4.00, it's pricey for the portion, but rich and delicious. \n\nWhether you are a student at the Claremont Colleges or not, give the Shakedown a try.

Theo and Dave were very helpful and they had a lot more knowledge about mattress then I expected. Theo helped me find the right mattress for my height and weight. Ive been sleeping on a firm mattress for a long time because i thought it was good for my back, but it wasn't cutting it. I wake up with numbness on my shoulders. He explained that's because I am a side sleeper. He suggested a pillowtop with strong foundation. I was so happy to figure out the reason and found  a solution to my low energy level during the day.\n\nI told them my budget, which was under a thousand and the bed was much more than that. Since this was a family owned business, they were able to offer me a great deal at a  fraction of the cost the high chain ends were offering me. For a similar mattress, it was double the price at Sears and Macy's. They worked with me on the price and even offered me two pillows for my queen size bed. Since it was a high end bed, they also threw mattress protectors. It was very cool- stain and water proof. \n\nDeliver service what very accommodating. They were available for me after my work schedule. They have many deliveries days. I got mine delivered free. They took my old mattress away and two men brought my new mattress in and set it all up for me. They were very careful with my house, which I was surprised. Friendly service from beginning to finish. \n\nI told my family about it and my sister and mom bought one as well. Give them a shot first before you invest in a mattress. They have multiple locations all around pasadena. They are doing so well because of their service and price that's why they are growing.

The program was a really small, intimate group of 12 and classes are conducted in French in Paris at the Reid Hall campus (with mandatory classes taken in French universities). \n\nFor anyone considering this program here are my thoughts.\n\nPros:\n-In Paris\n-Takes three semesters for the MA; from Sept Y1-Oct Y2\n-Small class size, students are well vetted and you really feel like you are among your academic peers\n-Some of CU's, France's and the UK's best and brightest (and well published) profs \n-Campus is small but beautiful and has many a quiet area for study\n-Semester three is all about writing the thesis; there are no classes (even though you pay for the semester, so this could maybe be a con) so you could conceivably get a job and/or travel while writing\n-Very nice/helpful administrative staff at Reid Hall\n\nCons:\n-Very literature focused for a \"cultural studies\" program; this could have something to do with the French view of cultural studies, but as a sociologist, it was frustrating to have to keep explaining what I wanted to write my thesis on and to fight for a thesis advisor that was not a literature professor, but (in my case) an urban sociologist\n-The dean is pretty hands off, so look elsewhere if you encounter problems\n-There's not a ton of special financial aid (one merit scholarship, based on French language skills, I believe), but it's only three semesters \n-Had some difficulty with the guy who has the racket on housing, but after complaining (a lot) I was moved to another apartment after 6 weeks\n\nIf you do decide to do the program, I would recommend looking into the CAF (aid the French gov. at least used to provide for all students, even foreigners); getting an apartment on your own to avoid the overhead of the guy who's in charge of the apartments (it's not as hard as it sounds; the entire city basically illegally sublets with little problems); and if you plan to work at all, you can plan around knowing that semester three has no classes just the thesis to write.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fco4qToL2DhnVamv0yaW4w"}

If we are lucky enough, however, sometimes fate will bring us to the best choice.\n\nMy experience at Tintura was incredible, considering they had done their best to save my hair. Here's the background story:.\n\n     Earlier in the afternoon I had had a dreadful experience at another salon (Salon Bloom). My hair was completely destroyed - considering the hairdresser had literally chopped off the top of my hair into a bob, and kept the bottom of my hair (which was to my mid-back) untouched. The hair cut cost me $85, and it literally looked my hair went into a war zone with the top half and the bottom half on opposite sides of the battle field. I was devastated and drove to the first hair place that could I find. \n\n     I drove into the Claremont Village and saw that Tintura's door was open. I walked in, red and puffy from a cry fest which had ensued for hours. Doris, the owner, greeted me. I told her that I had just come from a haircut and was extremely upset. She sat me down to look at the cut. She realized that my hair was a disaster and needed a good fix. Unfortunately, she told me, that the salon was closing within the next few minutes and that I could set up an appointment for the week, considering that they were booked. I told her I understood and was dismayed by yet another unfortunate event. Instead of sending me off, Doris kept me and asked her master stylist, Danielle (if I am not mistaken), if she would stay later. From the kindness of both of their hearts, they agreed to keep the doors open for just a little bit longer to fix the disaster ensuing on my head. Doris and Danielle were in the midst of clients, when they looked to see how they could fix my hair. They examined the angles, the different possibilities, and all through which, they were incredibly sincere and genuine. I waited for a few minutes, until Danielle was done with her current client.\n\n     Danielle was supposed to leave right after, but opted to stay to fix my hair. She talked through my choices and recommended the ones which would be most favorable to what I needed. In order to save it completely, I needed a good chop, one which I was not willing to make, considering my hair had already gone through a brutal chop I had not asked for. She figured a way to calm the dreadful layer and adjust the length to better fix the cut. She warned that to completely fix my hair would take time because I did not want to snip off the hair I had been trying to desperately grow. She spent a good 45 minutes adjusting, texturing, blending, and doing everything she could to make my hair look like actual hair, versus the waves of disgust the other salon had shaped it to be. She literally saved my hair.\n\n     The entire time I was getting my hair cut, both Danielle and Doris were incredibly sweet and comforting. They were not pushy and kept laughing at my constant, apologetic behavior. I was beyond grateful. When it came time to pay, Doris gave me a 20% discount, considering the haste of my situation and all of the problems I had gone through. I finally left with a smile on my face. Even though my hair has not fully recovered, it is in the best shape it could be (under the circumstances), and was cut by a professional stylist who actually cared enough to make a girl feel good about herself.\n\nFrom the depth of my heart, thank you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L6OpSiSJLgP6Jn7zJa_ZUg"}

I used to work here at this particular location, on and off for around 3 years. At first I loved it. (This may be due my previous 3 year employment in the Plaza food court. Needless to say, this was a step up.) Then I grew to hate it. (Don't worry though folks. I will not waste your time and review this poorly run company and the greedy corporate bastards that sent me in search of greener pastures. I will write a real review. But just in case you were wondering, this place is in fact run by buffoons.)\n\nON WITH THE REVIEW!\n\nIn all honesty, when it comes to shoe stores, RW is really as good as it gets if you don't want to venture into Nordstrom. And honestly, I NEVER want to venture into Nordstrom. And what RW has really accomplished, is the Nordstrom shoe department, in a shop the size of the Nordstrom women's restroom. Granted they're down to about half the inventory of Nordstrom, but the good stuff, the shoes you really want and look for, are all there. So It's Nordstrom minus all the crap. And minus all the FOB crap that Journey's carries. Not only is Journey's selection weak, but they only offer the kind of  colors that only the certain type of gentlemen who wear ill fitting saggy jeans, edge their hair and wear do rags, stroll in hoping  to find to match the brand new New Era cap they just purchased at LIDS. \n\nDon't tell me I'm wrong, because I'm not.\n\nAnd when they do have a decent color/style they almost never have your size. \n\nI happen to avoid shoe stores like Journey's and Sheik because I feel like the employees might actually mug me. There be some scary bitches up in there. And the Vans store employees? It's like their balls haven't dropped/ they haven't gotten their periods. I do not like asking a child if they believe I should go with the half size smaller because the canvas is going to stretch out enough over time. I'm sorry sweetie but a nod is not a real answer. At RW the customer service is still there. If there's one thing RW is known for, it's the ridiculous amount of customer service. During my initial training, my manager said they try to keep their customer service up to Nordsrtom standards. RW employees are schooled in footwear knowledge. I had to learn different type of toe styles, tread, and stitching as well as different types of leathers, cleaners, and how to properly fit a shoe. \n\nUnfortunately I have been back to this location and been disappointed with the customer service a few times. This made me a little sad because I remember the pride a lot of us took in knowing what we offered customers. (I GUESS we did have our moments where we left a not so kind impression on customers, but they deserved every bit of it, and we enjoyed every bit of it.)  I thought perhaps the company was loosing its old school emphasis on it's customer service. Luckily as of now, the current store manager is Adam. He is a delight and when dealing with his employees you can see his direct influence on them. Hopefully Robert Wayne continues to stay on track.\n\nHelpful Hints: \n-They don't give refunds! Store credit and exchange only. I know it sounds primitive, but their reasoning is that they most likely have something in store that will be to your liking, and if not you can special order from the vendor of your choice directly through them. \n- The employees work partially off commission, so be nice when they try to up sell. Its just part of their job. And all of the products really do work. That being said, sometimes we did lie about the fit/ availability to make a sale since there are not refunds. So go in with some common sense\n- Don't come here looking for out of this world deals. It's still the mall. But management does walk the malls on a regular basis and adjusts prices to keep up with competition. They also price match any competitor in the mall as long as the size and color are in stock. \n-They offer layaway which is nice. So you can purchase your UGGS in the summer and not rush to make what seems like a silly purchase considering the season, but isn't since that's when they really start loading up on winter inventory ;-)\n-They carry mens, women's, children, and baby sizes.\n-They are the absolute best place for Dr. Martens. THEE BEST. Hands down, from the in store selection to the special order process, RW is your best bet.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and say that Robert Wayne Footwear is a solid choice for your footwear needs.

I hate the term gastropub because it's usually code for over-priced menu with fancy decorations and sub-par food, so I refuse to group this place into that category. This place rocks from the dive bar look to the beer selection to the Mac-n-cheese. If you love beer , this place will easily become one of your favorites in the Boston area. \n\nFood is interesting, fresh and always tasty. Service has always been attentive and helpful. We're familiar with most of the beers on draft but they've been helpful with some friends who know nothing about beer. \n\nIf your thinking about popping your Hobo cherry, don't be scared by the rather plain exterior. Inside the large red curtain this place is clean and neat. Just be warned it can get a little crowded standing around the bar. After our first trip we decided to try the food because it looked so good and the whole experience was better sitting at a table. \n\nThe only Bad thing I can think of here is the parking situation. It's a little bit of a hike from the T and most of the parking is permit only. Since I don't live in Cambridge this has been a little frustrating but I don't see anything the Hobo crew can do about that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A3D8gBGNmt51kvcI0GkaGQ"}

The second time I went, I discovered the amazing Vegetable Ramen that had unique veggies and a really light broth that I found to be very subtle, but amazingly good; however, the burger quality had diminished somewhat.  The third time I went, the Duck Confit had been taken off the menu, as well as the Vegetable Ramen.  I just went last week and the Pork Belly had been reduced to a Chinatown quality piece of fried pork fat.  It was despicable.  Also, the organic IPA that I would use to wash it down with was gone too.  I ordered the Seoul Burger, and that too had diminished in quality.

I've been here five days a week for a year and have only had to wait to use a treadmill twice, which is awesome. Same deal applies for weight machines, spaces in class, showers, etc.\n- The front desk staff are, for the most part, incredibly friendly and accommodating. A few staff members in particular go out of their way to greet me by name every time I come in, and the overall customer service is great.\n- The gym is very accessible for those working in the Kendall area - in fact, there is virtually no competition in this neighborhood.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The layout of the gym is just plain awful. While the building has some \"industrial era\" charm, equipment is spread out into so many disparate places not by design, but by necessity, so doing a multi-part workout sometimes involves walking up and down hallways and multiple staircases in between segments. Additionally, the spin studio is only accessible through the aerobics studio, and neither is effectively soundproofed for competing noise (and basketball/racquetball noise from outside).\n- Repairs and upgrades to equipment... not so much. The facility is in terrible need of a remodel; the locker rooms in the basement are constantly flooding when it rains, the floor in the aerobics room creaks, and there is some equipment that is way past its prime. Improvements to the infrastructure don't seem to be high on CAC's priority list.\n- The class instructors appear to be very poorly vetted. Many are robotic and repetitive - one spin instructor in particular used the same playlist for every class for about four months straight. Some instructors may not be properly certified. Very few take the time to go over safety or setup precautions at the start of class, and even fewer take the time to interact with students individually to correct form. A shining exception to this trend is Ellen, who teaches Vinyasa yoga - she is absolutely fantastic, well qualified and attentive as an instructor should be. However, there doesn't seem to be formal procedure in place for evaluating classes or instructors, and the class schedule is changed only a few times a year. Group fitness is not a strong point for CAC in general.\n\nThe Ugly:\nI recently had a very bad experience with a Pilates instructor named Leah, who was outright rude and snotty to me, prompting me to send a letter to the general manager. The lack of response so far is a sorry indication of just how little attention is being paid to the member experience in group fitness classes at CAC, and how little effort seems to go toward ensuring that all instructors are qualified in terms of expertise, effectiveness, and professionalism. Unfortunately, this is the reason that I would ultimately NOT recommend joining this gym.", "type": "review", "business_id": "37jNprFs5eS7sHwqllcSrA"}

So, I decided to take a spontaneous trip to San Francisco to visit a few friends, but also to try out Kara's Cupcakes.  Most of my friends who had ended up going here while in SF have all said it was better than Sprinkles, which I'm sure all of you know is my favorite cupcake place of ALL time.  Anyways, let me try and give as unbiased a review as possible, and you can judge for yourself.\n\nKara's Cupcakes has a few locations up in the Bay Area, and for all intensive purposes, is a mom and pop shop.   They are a purebred cupcake shop and not a bakery, so I respect that.  They offer a variety of cupcakes but their most popular cupcake is called the Chocolate Velvet, which is a \"chocolate cupcake with a velvety bittersweet chocolate buttercream.\"  Pretty awesome description.  According to the staff helping me pick cupcakes at 10am on a Sunday morning, their second most popular cupcake is the Sweet Vanilla, which is basically a vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting.  No need for a detailed description there.  So, I ended up buying these two cupcakes to try out for myself, but also got a few extra so one of my friends, Monique, a fellow Sprinkle's fan, could also rate these cupcakes.  Since we both have basically the SAME tastes for cupcakes, let me share with ya'll what we concluded.\n\nOkay, so the Chocolate Velvet is a pretty phenomenal cupcake.  I was sitting in SFO with an Earl Grey tea and waiting for my delayed flight when I decided to devour this amazing cupcake.  This is basically a chocolate cupcake with a very light chocolate cream frosting, which is a perfect balance because it doesn't make it too overwhelming to eat.  The problem I have with most chocolate cupcakes is that it is just way too heavy and that I need a gallon of milk to comfortably finish one.  The cake was VERY moist and of perfect density, and the frosting was actually light enough where the chocolate flavor in the cake was stronger than the frosting!  That is quite unique, and I think this cupcake is definitely top 5 of all time of the places I have been to.  Monique says it is \"so light, yet chocolatey,\" and I completely agree.  This is just a cupcake that provides great balance, which I think is an important aspect that I feel like lots of cupcake places neglect (Crumbs is a place that fails miserably in this department.)  5 stars for this cupcake, and it's not number 1 because I am a bigger red velvet fan, but if I loved pure chocolate cupcakes, this would be top dog.\n\nAnyways, with high expectations now based on my first taste of Kara's with the Chocolate Velvet, I only assumed that the Sweet Vanilla would be just as good.  Oops.  This cupcake was actually, really bad, and I couldn't even finish it.  It is almost the completely opposite of the Chocolate Velvet, in that the frosting is way too sweet and heavy, and the cake was not that moist either.  I won't go into much detail, but don't get this cupcake.  \n\nI wasn't able to try the Fleur De Sel, which is a chocolate cupcake filled with caramel, but got Monique one, and she said that it was pretty good- the caramel inside was a nice surprise, but it was a bit salty and still not as good as the Chocolate Velvet.  The next time I am in SF, I will have to try this cupcake, especially since my friend Debbie, a Sprinkle's hater, says it is awesome.  \n\nSo, what's my final verdict?  The Chocolate Velvet is a great cupcake.  Everyone should try it because it really is just well made with quality ingredients and provides a perfect balance of chocolatey goodness.  I am disappointed it doesn't offer a red velvet flavor, which I think is a gold standard for a good cupcake, but that is obviously a bit of personal preference.  It seems that this place definitely has potential to be just as good as Sprinkles, but without a more diverse selection of flavors that are ALL good, it still doesn't beat the king.  I still think that Sprinkles, Violet's Cakes, and SusieCakes in Los Angeles still have an upper-hand over Kara's, and still highly recommend these places.  However, my trip to Kara's does inspire me to try something new in the kitchen- I'm going to try and make a red velvet cupcake with a much lighter and fluffier cream cheese frosting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RkYCZKSJ7Qhw7c7ognlm3A"}

Ahhh, sunny SoCal! :)\nI was taken to lunch at RFD today by my dear friend. I have been a vegetarian for 30 years, and he thought I would like this organic vegan restaurant.  He was right. Normally, I am not a fan of vegan food. I have had more than my fair share of bad \"mock meatloaf.\" Imagine my surprise then when my meal turned out to be awesome--and that's not all.\nFirst I ordered a cup of Jasmine tea from our WONDERFUL server, Steva (Celtic for Steven). What a sweeheart he was. I am married to a Chinese man, so I am very picky about my green tea being good quality. It was very tasty, decent grade Jasmine. Steva made sure my water refills were hot, in a new cup, something I am keen on. Sounds picky I know, but it was a detail he picked up on, without my having to ask for. I like conscientious servers. \nFrom there, I decided on the BLT Wrap (which was hysterical, because normally I would not be caught dead eating a \"wrap\").  My friend ordered the Total Rueben. The food came quickly, to my delight, as I was starving. My plate was piled high with a wrap that consisted of a thin (yum) spinach tortilla enveloping proportionate amounts of dark lettuce (read: not a mountain of crappy iceburg), chopped tomatoes, tremendous, crispy seitan bacon and a lovely chipotle mayo.  It also came with a vegan Caesar that was delish. My friend wasn't as thrilled with his lunch, and I can see why (hence, the four stars). His Rueben was anything but \"total.\" It was a wee thing, very thin, with stringy looking sauerkraut, tempeh, some 1000 Island dressing (can't believe they still make that stuff) and a meager salad. It definitely could have been more bountiful, which we pointed out to Steva. Anyhoo, I ate my entire plate of food, except for the salad which I gave to my hungry friend. \nWe then decided to order the Gluten Free Double Layer Chocolate Cake w/Raspberry Filling to split. Glad I didn't order a whole piece. Just so-so. I'm a baker, and I found it lackluster. Plus, I work in a European bakery, so I'm used to top-notch pastries, so my barometer isn't really unbiased, in fairness to RFD. The only other thing we commented on was the God-awful Muzac playing in the background.  Eddie Money???  Seriously? How about some jazz? Something unobtrusive. Or light classical? Or contemporary music?  Even hip hop would be fine. But EDDIE MONEY?? \nIn summary: the space is lovely, the food is good, the service we got was excellent, the prices were high but my food was plentiful and after all, this is SoCal and it is organic vegan food, so there ya go.  It ain't Taco Bell.  I definitely recommend this place, and I would definitely go back.  Thank you RFD for a nice experience and a nice afternoon!  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "ogFn9-iNXcJ4yFiN5ZsPow"}

And literally right next door to my apartment. It also has the added benefit of being efficient at providing drinks when I'm trying to rush to school in the morning, and the best part? BREAKFAST TACOOOOOOSSSS.\n\nSo the coffee here: consistently good, and I've never had a cup that wasn't fresh-tasting or adequately hot. I also really like their selection of tea. I don't know what brand it is, but they have really interesting ones like ginger-peach-blah blah blah and I think I saw a \"flowering\" tea on the menu that I have yet to try, since I'm usually pressed for time. I don't usually drink lattes or other milky stuff but I once had a mocha that was pretty good. \n\nAnd the breakfast tacos are yummmmmy. You can order 2 3-ingredient tacos and a coffee or tea for $5, and they custom make your tacos! No old eggs sittin' around getting gross. Plus they really don't take that long - maybe 10 minutes at the height of their morning rush, but usually more like 5 minutes. I like their ingredient options - they have things like organic spinach, avocado, and really good whole-wheat tortillas, in addition to standards, so you can mix it up. Recommended: avocado, potato and cheese, or spinach, egg and cheese. Their salsa is also pretty good but comes in those annoying and wasteful tiny containers.  While I know that having a big bowl of salsa out might violate some health codes or something, I really hate throwing away plastic needlessly. \n\nIn addition to breakfast tacos, they have bigger plates of breakfast food and other cafe standards like pastries and cookies and little cakes and stuff. I've tried their croissants (made by a local bakery, I forget which one), which are ok...not that memorable. \n\nThe seating arrangements are nice. They have a variety of tables and couches, so you can have your pick whether you're working on a laptop or just settling in for a sit-down. It usually isn't TOO crowded, and I've never had a problem finding a seat. I would also recommend this place over George's (right across the street in the law school), because it feels less stressed out and the quality is definitely better.

The burger was so dry that I had to take a sip of my drink with each bite just to keep from choking. I threw most of the food away. The ONLY good thing I had was lemon ice cream, which was pretty fucking over-priced (4 dollars for 2 tiny scoops) the only reason I got the ice cream was to get the taste of the burger out of my mouth. I can't believe this place has been in business for this long, apparently there aren't that many fast food places in downtown Atlanta (otherwise this place would have gone out of business decades ago) or else maybe this is the type of food that people in the south like, I don't know, and I don't care, I just know that I will never be back again.\n\nTo sum it up I'll say go if you want to \"say you've been there\" but for the food, skip it and go to McDonald's", "type": "review", "business_id": "sPhPI3B6tvcJIULhICr-Pg"}

Yesterday was that day, and I decided that damnit, I was finally gonna have me some southern fried chicken and mac & cheese from Miss Mamie's! I called in an order of their lunch special of southern fried chicken with a mac & cheese side for $7.95, and they had it ready by the time I got there.\n\n(word to the wise: $10 minimum on cards)\n\nBy the time I got back to the office, my mouth was watering after inhaling the blissful smells that were my chicken and mac & cheese. Immediately, I dove right in starting with the *block* of mac & cheese first. Just a note about that (and the reason I deducted a star): when my mac & cheese is in a literal block form (see attached photo), I expect there to be some powerful taste of the cheese and grease variety. After all, why would there be the necessary amount of cheese and grease to hold it together if it didn't? This, on the other hand, was pretty bland. Yeah, I said it. Even with all of the rave reviews of the mac & cheese on here, I didn't think it was all that impressive.\n\nI started to get a little nervous at this point, but once I took my first bite of the southern fried chicken, my looming anxiety evaporated. Perfectly cooked, juicy, and every bit as good as I was expecting. Even though I was full after the mac & cheese and the first chicken breast, I dove into the second and ate every last bite. This was the best southern fried chicken I've had in NYC (though there certainly isn't that much competition on that front).

The act of simply allowing some poor 18-year-old kid to purchase a bong with his or her hard earned lawn-mowing money would cause them to fall deeply into the bottomless pit of despair that is marijuana addiction.  But hell, promoting smoking pipe tobbaco straight out of a one-hit is alright.  Stupid American draconian drug-laws.\r\n\r\nThis store also contains left-wing propaganda ranging from hilarious anti-Bush parodies to disturbing tinfoil-hat conspiracy newsletters.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RIUwz7qFjkTaUoQPZRd3Fw"}

I tried Mina's here first, requested my layers and a brow tint. I left with a stiff bob, having been told the back had to be \"evened out\" and DARK - ridiculously dark brows that cost $25 even though I was quite seriously upset, and looked scary! But I was polite, so I paid and left, never to return to Mina's. Once my eyebrows faded, I ventured out again, this time to try the Beehive. First, from Meredith, I got layers in chunks, but good advice on how to deal with well water and hair washing. Tried Beehive again 5 weeks later. As I sat waiting and chilling, checking my emails (weekday afternoon= working!) and sending a quick text, I was called to Meredith's chair. I glanced up and said \"great, just a minute\"...and in seconds she called to me again, with a definite edge to her voice. I was really surprised. I was early and had been waiting for HER. But I was not bothered! And here she was sort of barking? Ok, it was a bit tense as I obediently got into the chair, feeling pretty awkward. Who wants an irritated-angry hairdresser? We talked a bit about the layers, she cut my hair for 10 minutes, and said, \"that's it, finished\". \nI was surprised, but she said she was trying to correct the previous layers, so that was all there was to do. OK. So I paid and left -  with another bob! - and a terrible feeling that I had been sort of ordered around, had a quick spin in the chair, and was out.\nUgh! Bad.\nI have not yet found someone here (Triangle) who can artfully cut subtle layers, and I mean it. I know my hair, I know how great it can look.

I was greeted by a nice woman who said hello when I went into the store.  A person ringing up a customer who was taking a bit long apologized on her own to me when I was waiting in line for it taking a bit to long while they were trying to get a customer a credit card.  A guy working there was good at trying to find something which was close to what I was looking for but not exactly it, and also was able to suggest website etc.. There was no pressure from the sales staff, a woman also tried to show me what jeans they had in my size, but they weren't blue ones.  I think the only thing I was disappointed at was they were having jeans on sale but had been sold out of my size in the blue.  While gap clothing is nothing extreamly special the prices are reasonable and one thing I loved is they actually have an XS size, since I happened to now get smaller than small size.  I hardly see this size anywhere but they had it in there sweet pants even though I assume a lot of people aren't this size, so that was way kool!!! since the small ones didn't fit anymore.  \n\nThe new store layout is really neat, and they have a wide variety of items, and some dressy clothes.  I found other things I wanted there but didn't have enough money to get this visit unfortunately.  I felt that I would just like to say that the service here was so much better than when I've been in the downtown store, and the employee's actually seemed like they knew what they were doing!!  There were even no issues at the register and the staff didn't pressure me to much about the gap card.  I enjoyed my visit shopping at the u village gap even though they didn't have the size jeans I am in blue on sale that day.  \n\nEven though it is a little further, I can't just walk to it like the one downtown, it almost is more worth going there than downtown, but they do carry some different things sometimes so I guess it will all just depend, I enjoyed u village though a lot more.  I think though just to note that one thing I do like about the gap is its not over priced like abercrombie and fitch or other style stores so that makes it nice to be able to get clothing on a tight budget.  I think one thing that I'd like to see improved is more clothing that appeal to younger people or teens.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gNEYtpdIFx_4zEGczAwKPQ"}

For some reason we chose Marathon, even knowing their level of speed is often a crapshoot.  Today we got lucky.\nThe 4 of us all ordered some Dogfish Heads and entrees (Bolognese Rigatoni, Wasabi Salmon, Mac N' Cheese, and some other pasta dish Mike got that I can't remember what was in it.)\nThe Wasabi Salmon actually looked awesome and it was gone from the plate in about 5 minutes due to my friends hunger.  My Mac N' Cheese was a bonus because I asked if I could add Chicken to it and they did....gratis.  That doesn't happen often!  Two of my buddies also got inspired by the table behind us and ordered a gigantic bottle of Chimay Blue...they thought it would cost around 15 bucks, but it cost 22.  The whole bill for 5 beers and 4 entrees came to 107 bucks...I didn't think it was too terrible considering the cost of the beers.  \nAlso on their way out the couple behind us had heard us talking about their giant beer so they gave the rest to us to finish because they had to make a movie next door...the same one we were trying to make.  Of course we got next door and I couldn't buy a ticket because it had become sold out with the person in front of me in line.  But I digress...this time the fault was mine and not the Marathon Grill.\nMy friend started his review of the MG last time by saying \"This place is death.\"  I think it can now be upgraded to \"this place is acceptable\".", "type": "review", "business_id": "u6r5eXG_-Bod_aXVprI09Q"}

So I Google the restaurant later and see if it's a new restaurant (I'd expect this from a new spot) but low and behold, they've been serving for 2 years or so....Come on yall, we GOTS to do better than this.\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS: So be prepared to not be able to order what your heart desires. Otherwise, love the ambiance, very intimate/low key spot. The baked chicken on the brunch menu...was amazing (coming from someone who doesn't order it while dining out b/c how many variations can you get) BUT 5 & Diamonds chicken....delicious.\n\nWhat's better, the mac & cheese....OMG!!!! Besides my own MOTHER'S mac & cheese, this place KILLS it! I sometimes crave it lol (both the truffle mac & cheese and the 5 & Diamond mac & cheese). ***Monday nights are 1/2 off cocktails and other menu items.

Topped with garlic naan (bread) and some rice, it was one of the more satisfying buffets I have had in Boston!\n\nDessert was kheer (rice pudding) and suji ka halwa (roasted vermicelli mixed with sweetened milk).

I am surprised at how this place has still not become popular for its buffets!!\n\nAll in all an enjoyable brunch experience at the standard buffet price of 12.55 dollars per person (tax included)...I would say put this on ur list of Indian buffets to try even if it is not exactly to die for!", "type": "review", "business_id": "INaAXfbIXtXTB3sSDX8Wow"}

Well 4 years of my life says yes.  MIT is an experience like none other...well that may not be right.  If you want the MIT experience at home, here is how you do it:\n1)grab lower lip, rusty nail, and peanut butter\n2)pull lower lip over top of head and pull until it is approximately ear level.\n3)hammer rusty nail into back of head, securing lip in position.\nMIT, home to some of the greatest minds in the world, has be likened to drinking from a fire hose.  I mean the most basic math course offered is calculus, that says something, right?  This is not your state school college experience: pulling all nighters to actually complete homework, having to stay awake in class and still not fully understanding the professor, and no naked mile.  On the topic of nudity, yes you can find it, and no, you don't want to find it.  There is a saying about MIT when it comes to the opposite sex (works both ways...what does that say about me?), 'The odds are good, but the goods are odd.'  Split into two campuses, east and west campus, one can go from a world of fake Louis Vuitton bags and over eager skinny frat guys, to one of sheer insanity (retinal scanners on doors, hot tubs that drive around, huge murals dedicated to pokemen (the plural of pokeman?)).  Not for the feint of heart this institution takes you as you are, beats you to a pulp, pours you into a genius mold, then pops you in the fridge over night to chill.\n\nMajors range from Architecture to Computer Engineering, having something for all tech-heads.  Most classes run 1 hour (three times a week) to 1.5 hours (twice a week) for lecture and additional time for recitation.  Looking to supplement your own education, whether you are at MIT or not, most people look towards MIT's OpenCourseware, a free internet database of the classes offered there.  In addition to always learning new things, it is common for students to work in a lab outside of class.  I built satellites in my free time with MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science, giving me the priceless skills of: using MATLAB, using machining equipment, breaking machining equipment, siphoning antifreeze with my mouth, visiting the hospital on a regular occasion, soldering.\n\nThe campus has recently been kicked up a notch with new buildings dedication to student housing, Neuroscience, and Computer science.  All the buildings are given numbers (as well as some names), which is what the students refer to them as (same goes for classes).  Inside note, all even buildings are on one side and odds on the other side.  Some of the buildings referred to by name are the Stata Center, all the dormitories, Richard Cockburn Maclurn, Ellen Swallow Richards, yes, those last two actually exist, I was surprised too.\n\nBottom Line: This very unpretentious school packs one hell of a punch.  Bring the antidepressants and enroll in Calc I (18.01).  If you choose Physics like I did, be prepared for a long haul, then grad school if you actually want to use your degree.", "type": "review", "business_id": "970s01xAU8Yv-lAQaBXvNA"}

Got the channa masala, which was pretty good, the baigan bharta (or whatever it's called), which was a little too sweet of a curry for me, and something else that was obviously forgettable and probably got mixed in with my other options. \n\nThe second time I had the #1 combo, cause on the weekends its only $5.99. Got the chicken tikka masala (probably the most recognizable/cliche item to order), aloo mutter, and some super spicy beef curry. The food was a lot better this time around; it was under-spiced, and I managed to get a taste of all three options without one over-powering the other. \n\nNote: The chicken tikka masala tastes JUST like the frozen entree you can get at Trader Joes. Don't know if that's just TJ being awesome, or BC being lame...\n\nThe curries are way too watery for my liking... so watery that the curries just kind of blend together to create a schloppy mess. Sure, they're supposed to be pretty soupy (to dip in your naan, I suppose?) but there's like no meat in there whatsoever.  The naan was just plain meh too, not fresh and rather bland. \n\nI do really like the mint chutney though, it cuts a lot of the spicy.\n\nAnd yes, I gave it a 2 star review, but will I be back?

First off, the Yard Sale (2 courses and a side for $25!) is a great deal. I had the corn and crab chowder as a starter, which was a bit of a let-down-- not super-flavorful or crabby and nothing special, really, though the cute stone-handled bowl it came in was a plus. My friend's crab cake starter was far more delicious (and far more crabby!) with a tasty salad and side cucumber-caper-sauce concoction. The spinach salad with chevre also looked amazing.\n\nI had the pulled lamb shank as my main course, and it was ok, though not what I was expecting-- it resembled more of a stew or cassoulet than a lamb shank as I imagined it, and as such, seemed better-suited for a robust winter meal than a summer supper in June. My friend's duck dish, though-- AMAZING! We thought the duck breast was delicious until we had the leg confit, which was far MORE delicious. Definitely get the duck. The sides were plentiful but nothing super-special.\n\nBy the time dessert rolled around, we were too full, and the dessert menu seemed overpriced after the Yard Sale steal. The check came with some ginger cookies though, so it was a win anyway. Bottom line for me: the Yard Sale is a bargain, but for the full price, not quite worth it, depending on what you order-- also, the service and ambiance is more family-restaurant style than I expected for a relatively fancy place.

The iced drinks (and all non-thermos coffee) has to be ordered from the same place as the sandwich line.  Stood in line for about 10 minutes watching two workers attempt to make two sandwiches for the people in front of me-- the main holdup seemed to be that one of them was completely stymied about what to do if she needed to make a small sandwich but had a large piece of bread.  Excruciatingly watched her contemplate cutting the bread into halves to make a smaller piece, putting it back, fetching it again, putting it back, asking her co-workers, getting a manager, and still not being able to figure it out after being told to cut it.  ???   Anyway, by then a bunch of other people had put their pieces of paper with sandwich orders up on the table.  Of course, there's no place on the papers for drink orders-- you just have to stand around and interrupt them to make sure they actually wait on you instead of grabbing new sandwich orders.\n\nOrder my drink (iced mocha), and after about 5 minutes, I'm handed a hot mocha.  Grrrr.  Ask if I can have some ice so that I can chill it myself-- they say no, they have to remake it, it will just be two minutes. I'm not really feeling like waiting to repeat this process, so just repeat the request for a cup of ice; no dice. Oh well. \n\nSo go stand in line to pay.  Turns out that they're out of regular coffees, so the cashier abandons the register to grab some cups, go to the back, and bring out cups of coffee for the people who are standing near the coffee machine.  By the time I pay, it's been 20 minutes since I entered the store, just so I can pay almost $4 for a cup of hot mocha that isn't what I ordered.

The guy is just not up to snuff for a place like this. \n\nHe spends time talking to his friends and acquaintances about his own personal life and neglects other customers. On our first visit after my bad review, he offered to let me taste one of the wine by the glass offerings that he had suggested to go with some food I had ordered.  When I wrinkled my nose at it, he whisked the glass away and said well, what else would you like? On our last visit he forgot my husband's request for a second drink because he was busy chatting with his friends. Then he double charged us for one of our food items. \n\nAfter our last three visits (yes we gave it three tries with this bartender) it has slipped off our radar for good. \n\nBetter sophisticated bar choices for mature folks in Harvard Square are Sandrine's, Rialto, Casablaca (a little noisy). Actually the bar at Legal Seafood is not bad either. I even prefer the bar at Cambridge One for a pizza or salad snack to the indifferent service at the Harvest. In Central Square, Central Kitchen, Rendevous, and Craigie on Main are excellent sophisticated bar choices...way better than the Harvest. \n\nBy the way, this wouldn't put me off from eating a seated meal at the Harvest, especially in summer when the terrace is open.

My one piece of advice is to put some some picnic tables outside where you can get messy with the food.  \n\nTheir signature dish is the half-rack of ribs.  You can order them either wet or dry.  I was with a friend so we got both.  \n\nWe were pleased with both.  The sauce is sweet and spicy.  Meat was tender.  \n\nIf you need extra sauce they are more than happy to provide a pretty good pepper sauce as well as a selection of both homemade and bottled hot sauce.\n\nDecent sides include slaw, collards, corn cakes, etc.  Cornbread was a little dry.  But overall good selection.  \n\nThey have a great bar with tons of local beers to choose from.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uIhwJtKaUDXUm0_3RY6uRg"}

I ordered a black coffee and Angie's Famous Melt (Homefries, saut\u00e9ed onions,pepper, ham, smoked sausage, bacon, 2 eggs, any style topped with melted cheese) Let me say this, the portions are huge. My order was enough to satisfy two hungry people. The melt had a little too much potato for my taste(they put a lot ), but overall it was pretty good. The waitress mixed up my request for no ham with my friends and ended up giving me ham and leaving it out of his, however, she noticed this herself right away and asked if I wanted it remade, but it didn't matter enough for me to wait again. \n\nThe food did take a while to prepare (half an hour?), so just based on my experience, I would only go if I had time to sit down and enjoy my food. I also enjoyed the small town diner interior. I think it definitely added some character and charm! As another yelper mentioned it does have a very \"homey feel\".", "type": "review", "business_id": "KBSD-XNDRjWi7JCDK9IpMg"}

In fact, there are lots of clothes for small people here (seriously: I'm a dude with shirt size of 14 1/2 and I find shirts here every time).

Like $20 dollars for the most basic t-shirt...and it goes up from there. The cheapest button down shirt (totally plain) is like $50+ dollars. Next, the return policy sucks. No cash refunds whatsoever. Even if you bought the item ten minutes before. Only store credit. Third, sex scandals/union busting.

Probably my expectations were too high. I was hoping for transcendent and got just fine.\n\nI had been thinking that my companions and I would go in for a tasting menu, but we were all exhausted and didn't think we could do 6 courses, so we just did the pre-fixe. I was in a weird mood and ordered two things I never order-- soup (pumpkin) and chicken (stuffed with chicken sausage).\n\nBut before I go any further about the menu or the food, I need to say this: the bread basket is so perfunctory/terrible that I wish they just hadn't brought any bread. I mean, the bread was COLD, colder than room temp.  And not baked on the premises, I'm pretty sure. The butter was also too cold to be spreadable.  Look, I don't advocate filling up on bread before what is meant to be an amazing meal, but I just found it strange that Craigie wouldn't try to do something to make the bread not suck so much. The bread basket made the statement that no one should care about the bread basket. It was a mockery of bread baskets and diners who love their free bread.  \n\nNow that that tangent is out of the way, here's how the rest of the food went down: pumpkin soup was good, but not amazing. Came with a delicious sliver of grilled cheese and pork belly panini.  It was served with a comically large spoon. Friends got fusilli with confit chicken and veg and the smelts. No rave reviews on either -- but no complaints.  My chicken was very tender and obviously high quality meat -- but there was very little sausage, like a small \"ribbon\" of it through the breast. And it just wasn't that flavorful. I did taste my friend's swordfish and thought it was very good -- I probably should have gotten either pork or fish. \n\nWe also shared a side of brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat. They were tasty and I love b sprouts, but I couldn't really detect the duck fat flavor....which I thought was what was going to make them special/memorable. They smelled amazing, though. \n\nMy panna cotta for dessert was excellent -- light but creamy, and the granola gave it a nice crunch.  \n\nAll in all, nothing was bad, but nothing was stellar.

We sat there watching the fondue coagulate into a lump of cheese and oil.  Please--were we supposed to dip a spoon in and eat the cheese like a soup?  Were we offered a comped appetizer, an offer to heat the fondue back up, or even an apology?  No.  Drinks/water apparently refilled only upon repeated request.  Surprisingly the waiter didn't recommend the skirt steak (which I thought would have been a shoe-in signature dish), but instead suggested the twice-as-expensive filet mignon, with bacon and a peppercorn sauce that muddled the flavors of the already slightly bland filet mignon.  I would have expected more flavor from Argentinian food.  At least they know how to cook a steak to its desired doneness.  Disappointing experience with a $35 per person price tag.\n\nRecommended Items:\nNothing we ended up eating there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA"}

I was in college and it was the most glorious thing to happen to me before graduating.  Yeah, it was weird sometimes seeing my dad  sitting at the bar, chumming it up with the staff when I rolled in with my college buddies, but it was worth it every time.\n \nThe menu is perfect: big and topped nachos (don't worry, you get used to the chili in the place of salsa); the biggest potato skins outside of Idaho; fresh hot, cripsy fries (waffle or crinkle); lots of  cold beers on tap (including a $2-something Huge Coors Light); fresh, tasty sandwich wraps; endless sodas; pool; a jukebox; and that's not even mentioning the wings yet!  \n\nWho am I kidding?  We all go there for the wings, but you know it's a good place when you can order anything on the menu with confidence.  The wings are juicy and bigger than the norm (both boneless and on the bone).  One order can have numerous flavored sauces added to it (according to how big it is).  The plates are huge enough to split and still take some home, even if you follow the sizing suggestions.  And the ambiance is a place that I can call home: pub-like with a roll of paper towels on the table.  Hey, it used to be my dad's favorite haunt, guess it was a lot like home for me.

I ordered the portobello panini, and it was a mushroom-based slice of heaven. Mozzarella cheese, basil, toasted to perfection. In fact, it was reminiscent of Coupa's version, but--dare I say--better. Like Coupa, however, it came with a side salad of fancy greens. Can't those of us who only eat iceberg and romaine lettuce get a little love? I definitively declare--CoHo is once again THE place to eat on campus. Now if only they could bring back the BCC...", "type": "review", "business_id": "DLaAK2VYMGd-vodPtp7aoA"}

I wish I had found this earlier. Apparantly, it is only when I decide to move OUT of Harlem that I find something good nearby.\n\nNot only was the food not horrible overpriced (like the rest of the UWS), it was GOOD!! I find most everything here to be either poor quality or horribly bland. Pisticci was neither.\n\nWe started with the mussels in tomato-basil broth. It was light, and the mussels were large, meaty, and flavorful. To top it off, the texture was perfect. Not stringy or overcooked in the slightest.\n\nFor entrees, we both got specials. The cavatelli with veal ragu was hearty and heavy just like I wanted. The pasta was thick and held up well to the sauce (and even reheated quite well for breakfast this morning, since I cold only finish half of it). The linguini (?) with crab and spinich was light, and great to start spring. The sauce didn't overpower the crab at all. Well done!\n\nThe desserts were OK. The pineapple cake was good. The frangelico chocolate mousse was fine, but I couldn't taste any hint of frangelico. I think it's sad when a restaurant serves up desserts that aren't as good as the food, since it is the note that finishes the night. But then again, the food was really good. \n\nThe only warning I would give is that the specials are much more expensive than the listed entrees and pasta dishes (but stll are pretty inexpensive for what you get). The main entrees range from $9.99 to around 15. Our specials were $18 and $21.

There is no MSG because the broth is made with time, care, and the proper amount of natural seasoning (which is expensive, mind you, and is the reason why the other places have to use so much MSG.)\n\nMeticulous attention to detail regarding the food (pho noodles are precooked in extra strong broth and the tripe is marinated in extra strong broth for flavor, etc) and regarding the ambiance (the chicken coop wire on the cabinets behind the bar match the pattern on the fireplace cover).\n\nThe service is fantastic. Everyone here is really nice!\n\nBut to be honest, I come here for the food. It's my favorite pho and I've had a LOT of pho in my lifetime. No poorly cut meats, no MSG, organic ingredients, no post-pho dehydration, delicious noodles, delicious broth, etc... etc...

In fact, it was ranked #17 for \"Best Beer Restaurants 2010\" by RateBeer. If it's your first time there, or you're just not familiar with their selection, ask any server for explanations or recommendations. They're there to help. The menu also serves as a decent guide because it grades each beer according to a Flavor Rating, from a \"no flavor\" 1 to a \"full-bodied\" 9. So if you're used to your favorite Heineken and not sure about trying a robust imperial stout, refer to the numbers for guidance and simply work your way up!\n\nPROS: You can find craft beers from across the world, especially great American microbreweries, and they'll carry many regional/local beers that are hard to find outside Michigan. They also offer rotating taps, seasonals, and special selections available for a limited time. (See the chalkboard inside for current off-menu specials. You'll know what I'm talking about when you walk in.) Also, though there are some rare and expensive choices like the Dogfish Head World Wide Stout or Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock, I find most prices to be very reasonable, especially considering your many options. The service also is pretty good. I can't speak much about their food since I rarely, if ever, eat anything there, but the pesto fries I once tried definitely hit the spot.\n\nCONS: It's relatively small, so you might have to wait even on a weeknight. It's also a campus bar/pub, so don't expect any elegant ambiance even if the beer selection itself is pretty \"high-class.\" I personally don't care much for proper glassware/beer pairing, but if you're the type that absolutely needs the snifter glass for a stout or barley wine, for example, you may be disappointed. (Some beers do come in the \"right\" glassware, but more often than not, they will just be the generic pint glass.) Lastly, you'll occasionally run into times when your top 2-3 choices are sold out, but I guess that's no different from other places.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great bar known most for their beer selection, though they also have liquor/wine/cocktails if you're interested. But honestly, if you're not that into the beer selection, there is no real reason to be there because there are other bars after all. If you want to break out of the typical mass-produced beers (you know, the ones with TV commercials), Ashley's is the place to learn and explore the world of craft beer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lLsG4YKZfM1c2QPKeZFvgQ"}

Never actually got into the back dining room as they were booked and it was a spur of the moment decision to finally make it over to this place, but we managed to walk in just as a table in the bar area freed up so there we stayed.  It got a little chilly when people would come in, but it was very cozy and nice to be near the bar which is small and well-done.\n\nThe service was excellent - I pretty much fell in love with our waitress, Heather, and wanted to put her in my pocket and take her home with me.  She was warm, welcoming, friendly, and just the right level of chatty through the entire evening.  \n\nWe followed her suggestion and tried something from every section of the menu, including a delicious bottle of wine.  The croque monsieur biscuits were served in a mini cast iron pan (emphasis on the mini), and was almost like an oversized amuse bouche for two.  We tried the charcuterie board which was probably the only let down of the meal.  Don't get me wrong - it was good - but it came with toast instead of bread which I don't like, and the meat(s) were hard to cut/spread.  This is, however, all in comparison to the charcuterie board at ES, which may be the best in boston, so perhaps my standards are too high?\n\nMoving on, the entree decision was exceedingly hard to make, but I settled on the roast chicken after finding that the winter vegetable was glazed carrots (a fav!).  My boyfriend got the pork shoulder, and I can't express to you how absolutely fantastic every single element of both of our dishes were.  My chicken was cooked to perfection, and his pork made me swoon (that's what she said?).  You know how sometimes you like most of your dish, but there's maybe one side or one little component that you'd rather have switched for something, or brings down the quality of the whole a tiny bit?  You'll find none of that here.  We also got the cornbread which is crazy different than anywhere else, and crazy good.  Go for it.\n\nCouldn't leave without checking out the southern dessert options, which was also a very hard decision.  BF got the pudding (insert Bill Cosby voiceover), and I went for the sticky toffee pudding.  Oh man, just thinking about it now I'm salivating.  It was perfect.\n\nToward the end of the meal we chatted more with Heather and with a gentleman who I think is the manager and perhaps co-owner, as they told us a bit about the wall of names and we talked digestifs (and tried some).  It was definitely a memorable meal, a gourmet southern experience if you will, and it's earned its place in my brainspace as a restaurant to which i'll return, and will wholeheartedly recommend to others.\n\nThe end.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DfrvJL-6H5i1nsyL6H6VGg"}

This was my first time visiting the restaurant, and the staff really went out of their way to make this a special evening for my father, we had a great table next to the fire, and since I had told them my dad's name, every menu had Happy Birthday to him at the top. It made him smile, it was fantastic! \n\nThe service was impeccable, our server, Michelle helped us make great wine selections based on our taste, and now we have some new favorites. She was also instrumental in making great suggestions from the incredible menu. I had the Napa Chopped Salad which tasted extremely fresh and included my favorite vegetable - beets, the salad had a sweetness to it from the harvest nuts, and was much more unique than other run of the mill house salads or Caesar at other restaurants. For an entree I had the Wild Diver Scallops, which were incredibly tender and soft with a flavor that sneaks up on you from the spring carrot puree. I also enjoyed the broccolini, I sampled some of the Amish Pork Chop and I don't think I have had a more tender piece of pork and I did live in Iowa at one point. \n\nMichelle was so great in helping my mother who recently became gluten free, navigate the menu to make selections based off of her diet restrictions, she even double checked with the chef to assure my mom! \n\nSo I have to say that this has been one of the most positive dining experiences I have had in Los Angeles or anywhere. There have been times in the past where I have called restaurants for special occasions, and they don't remember when you show up or don't take a special note of it.

It was parked across Wilshire Blvd. right next to Sur La Table.  Seeing only two people in line,  we hustled on over.  \n\nWe were intercepted on the way by two Russian brides looking for powdered milk for their children.  We directed them to Whole Foods, Having done our civic good deed for the day, we then bellied up to the bar and had a look at the goods.  \n\nThe first thing I noticed about the Calbi truck was its overly simplistic menu.  You can get a taco, burrito or quesadilla.  Beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc.  That's it.  Period.  No five cheese Chalupas.  No tacos with Concord grapes, sauteed ocelot livers and braised puffer fish sauce topped with foie gras sorbet.  Just very straight forward fare.  \n\nWe opted to get a few of the tacos--beef, pork and shrimp--and a kimchee quesadilla with beef.  More on the quesadilla later.  \n\nThe tacos were good for the price.  Fresh, light, not drowning in sauce, pretty much just right.  They were a tad salty but I am somewhat salt sensitive to begin with.  Flavor was good, and the veggies were crisp and fresh.  Didn't blow me away but solid overall.  \n\nThe quesadilla, on the other hand, was...alas, in the now immortal words of Clara Peller, \"Where's the beef?\"  We looked...and ate...and looked.  Didn't find any.  \n\nTo me, a meatless quesadilla is like a porno with no money shot.  \n\nDissatisfied, we went up to the counter and, to their credit, the Calbi Truck folks did make us another 'dilla, this time with the beef we originally asked for, but way less kimchee than the previous one.  If we had been able to put them both together to make one giant, gooey Korean quesadilla then it would have been pretty damn good!  \n\nConsidering the minimalist menu, screwing up an order is fairly unforgivable, but they did make amends to a degree.  \n\nOverall, the Calbi Truck was solid but unspectacular.  It's a nice consolation prize if the Kogi Truck is nowhere in sight, but still, compared to King Kogi, it's the Charlie Murphy to Kogi's Eddie.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lIPv3-ocdPvkiiE6JaQi9w"}

If not, try one of the many sushi joints in nearby Princeton.  =)", "type": "review", "business_id": "l5U3gn9lknos7YSXa8FybQ"}

It dates back to the years following Custer's Last Stand, and was updated once in 1963. Frankly, I'm convinced that many items haven't been touched ever since. Thus, things can get surprisingly meta once you realize the museum is kind of a museum of an old museum. \n\nHaving said all that, I love this place and probably always will. When I was a kid, my parents took me here all the time, and it ignited a curiosity that's fueled my soul for decades. I often think of the eerie room with dioramas showing single-celled organisms progressively evolving into other animals, at which point I realize that it taught me everything about evolution I would need to know at age 5.   Likewise, the main room's dinosaur was the first mega-lizard that captivated me, and the half-buried dinosaur towards the back wall--serving as a large visual example of paleontologist's work--is exciting for engaged children. On floor 2 there is educational taxidermy of every variety, and an awesome model of lake germs. \n\nThe giddiness is cranked up further on the 3rd floor. Here lies the planetarium, a huge canoe that is somehow incredible in the context of a darkened room, and a 50 pound rock that once served as currency. Worry not, as the museum provides explanation for the close proximity of these seemingly unrelated gems. I'm just working from sense memory here. \n\nI suppose as a young child my political correctness wasn't fully developed, so I saw no problem with the incredible Native-American dioramas on the 3rd floor. And that's good, because those dioramas taught me so much about tepees, tribes, Native-American spirituality, and societies unlike my own. Even if there were some factual inaccuracies, I learned about the existence of these things. They were previously foreign to me as a young child. \n\nBut sadly, after mulling over the issue for a decade, the director decided to have them all removed. Some who found the dioramas suddenly horrific made suggestions of how to alter them, as there were worries about stereotypes and the unspoken implications that Native-Americans are extinct. And I think that makes sense, to a degree. They should be altered to make those points clear. \n\nBut rather than investing time or resource in putting up placards or fixing the damn things, the lethargic director simply had them removed. What an unfortunate decision. When I saw those dioramas, it encouraged me to do some reading or--brace yourself--ask my parents or teacher about the details! Now some children won't even know that said details exist to be questioned.\n\n Part of what museums should do is spark interest, at which point facts can be sought and the diorama's shortcomings explained. I was five when I first saw them, and I don't think it took long to realize there's a difference between \"Native-American\" and \"dinosaur.\" Give people some credit, NHM. \n\nOtherwise, I love this place and it's actually far better than newer alternatives in the area. I'll be taking my kids here. Hell, maybe even I can go this weekend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_wDVgYIaa42g3Wz5jNTxZQ"}

The lower roof is pocked with bubbles of various sizes.

And I found the bartender to be very nice.  But beyond that, it's not my scene here.  This place is just too sleek and modern for me, too cold.  The look-and-feel of the decor and the sort of atmosphere it creates doesn't make me feel comfortable or at home.  I also really dislike the building this place is in, and the effect it has on the vibe of the neighborhood.  There's an outdoor seating area, with these giant fire pits...but it does not feel cozy to me.  The fire pits strike me as contrived, artificial, and you can't set your beer down on these tables lest the fire heats it up an uncomfortable amount.  The whole terrace outdoors has an unnatural feel...the surfaces are very plain, sleek, and the only nature in sight are a few newly planted (and mostly non-native) trees.\n\nPhilly is filled with old, homey bars in old buildings with character, and many have outdoor seating areas with big old trees.  This is a new bar and it screams one and only one thing: MONEY-MAKER.\n\nI also think the beers tend to be on the pricey side.  Many of them I've obtained cheaper elsewhere.  I wonder how much of the cost of each beer goes to pay the probably-exorbitant rent in this place.  That's not where I want my money going...encouraging developers to build more eyesores like this building.\n\nI think there are many better places to enjoy good beer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LwX2vbzttWYAdoBoVtfvRg"}

I flew in hours before our dinner, so no reservation was made.  Fortunately that evening, we arrived early and there was space in the basement hallway.  The basement area has the ambiance of a wine cellar.  While the sound was bouncing off the walls, it was much quieter than the main dining room (very loud).  \n\nFor our appetizers, we order the veggie Samosas and the Coriander Calamari.  The samosa is a golden-fried, conehead pastry puff filled w/ vegetable and is good with dipping sauce. The calamari is lightly breaded and fried, cooked perfectly and served with a tasty sauce.\n\nOur soup dishes are the Taj Mahal Soup and the Mulligatawny Soup.  The Taj Mahal is a puree of lentils and vegetables, while the Mulligatawny is also a puree of chicken, apples and veggies.  The Mulligatawny is very good but the Taj Mahal is highly recommended.  We have our soup with onion & cilantro naan.\n\nWith our soup and appetizers, we probably should have stopped with all our plates being fairly large in portion.  But we have a few bites of our entrees with the expectation to save the rest for takeaway.  The entrees each turned out to be only ok.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had good chicken cubes but I've had better flavor elsewhere. And our Clay Pit Vegetable Stir Fry and Channa Masala seemed to taste similar and thus a disappointment.\n\nAs far as the heat of this place, the waitress will ask the table if you want mild, medium, hot and desi (super hot).  Medium tends to be the average, so we go with that.  Everything up to the appetizer was medium, but the entrees were more on the hot side.  I recommend to err on the side of caution when ordering spicy - especially when you are with others!\n\nWhile there were some highlights in the menu, there were some dishes that would have been okay to skip.  I would have given this place 2 stars because of the entrees and the noise level, but there were some good points.  So 3 stars it is.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KK-6rXbIo9B4-b_P5WO5Qg"}

The skin is too thick and the variety of ingredients in the roll doesn't much resemble a traditional Vietnamese spring roll. The dipping sauce (nuoc cham) is too sweet and doesn't taste right either.\n\nThe pho is even more disappointing. The broth is devoid of flavor. It's easy to tell that the soup was not cooked with beef bones for hours, and none of the proper spices such as star anise were used. It's served with lettuce instead of the plate of bean sprouts, basil, cilantro and mint leaves that usually accompany the dish. As mentioned earlier, the traditional condiments were not available on the table so I had to ask for them. No soup spoon was provided, and let me tell you, eating soup with a shallow tablespoon doesn't work too well. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this is the only \"Vietnamese\" restaurant in the city.

A charming place to satisfy such urge is The Dog and Duck Pub. Though British in decor, showing up with Irish eyes, smiling or otherwise, isn't out of place. Upon entering, the video games, jukebox, pool table, and dart boards let you know that your true reason for visiting had better be to chill out. Speak of which, a generous beer selection awaits behind the bar. Be warned that, if you visit during this particular week, you'll be getting a limited menu. This is due to adjustments being made in preparation for the much-ballyhooed S X SW music extravaganza. Admittedly I was cheesed off a bit by not having a full menu to work with but, thankfully a stalwart pub standby was still available...the fish and chips basket. \n\nFor those not quite yet comfortable with jumping headlong into the land of pub grub more Americanized options such as veggie burgers and, for you comfort food mavens out there, the humble grilled cheese sandwich await. However, not trying out the aforementioned fish and chips basket would be a big mistake because both are sinfully delicious!! The beer-battered pollock comes with tartar sauce but who needs it? Such robust flavor to complement amazing crispness. As for the chips, they're neither wussy nor overly huge. They too were satisfyingly crisp.\n\nIf there was any knock regarding Dog and Duck it entails the service. Not being a pub crawler ordinarily I was unaware that you seat yourself. There was no sign to alert me to that. When I did make my way to a comfy seat the waitperson asked if there was anything I needed. I find that somewhat of a needless question whether I'm dining in a pub, steakhouse or wherever my palate takes me. How about a menu? Even if she had assumed maybe I was only there to knock down a pint of stout, even the offer of a beer list would have been sporting. A menu and a water refill are simply two things that don't need to be asked for by a diner...they're standards.\n\nStill, it's hard to be too harsh when you're in the presence of an atmosphere that radiates with amiable folks having a good time, as I'm sure was true for the large grouping next to me, some of whom clad in Hawaiian-style print shirts. When those around you come off as relaxed it's easier for you yourself to do likewise. Want great pub grub and a renewed license to chill? The Dog and Duck Pub doesn't disappoint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "if5aZcWOPM0FDbG8SZ_D6A"}

I have gone in here several times before requesting the same item, spending time gently conveying what I want, trying to be considerate of the ESL factor. \n     Dear Korean Manager: I am respectful of the fact that you have a difficult time understanding what I am asking for, even when you keep telling me \"you need to decide what is right for you, I can't decide what is right for you\" in response to different versions of my request. I wait as you quickly and politely serve an Asian customer who came in after me. I want to use your wifi, so am patient when you tell me that it is \"too early\" for the espresso machine to work and ignore me when I ask if I could have a coffee. I sigh in relief when we settle on hot peppermint tea, only to find out that all sizes of tea are below your credit card minimum of $2 (why would any coffee/tea shop have a card minimum?). When I explain I have no cash, you tell me a few more times that  \"you need to decide what is right for you, I can't decide what is right for you\". I tell you I am not trying to be rude, to which you detonate a variety pack of: \"you take too long\" \"I don't have time for you\" \"I am so busy\" \"I am right, you are wrong\". I silently left you to sweep your floor, unbothered by an empty shop.\nI do not believe the customer is always right, but you have proven that you are inconsiderate and discriminatory, both of which are unacceptable in any setting, especially the service industry. Go in peace and stack your dusty coffee cups like the insensitive, reverse-racist that you are. I hope no patrons ever disturb you again.\n\nDear Boba Lovers:Don't support these values, even if \"there are only a couple options\" in the USC area. Your dollars are your voice. Take them to cup o' joy. Take them to mello jello. Don't use them to condone a business who values extortionist profit (see other reviews) over the descent treatment of customers. \n\nI am going to tape this review up on the dingy little shop so that all the people who blithely enter without having consulted yelp will patronize one of the two other boba places in the neighborhood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G9A4F5Oi2v0lEkqf27Igzg"}

Okay, so maybe I'm sensitive, whatever.  \nWe order our drinks and hookah, I take the Noir wine and the Existential Octopus; it comes served at a balmy 80 degrees, on a warm summer night.  I'm not sure if some take their wine warm, but I do not.  I requested a Mango smoothie instead, to cool me off and sweeten up the smoke a bit - which even the smoothie was a little watered down.  The hookah on the other hand, was very smooth and satisfying.  We also ended up ordering the chicken shwarma, which was pretty tasty with warm pita.  \nThe bar itself is comfortable, however the music that was playing was kind of strange to me in this setting: mid to late 90s girl bands and pop.

Heard numerous accolades for its seafood in San Diego Magazine, not to mention my mom had a craving for oysters. I made a reservation on Opentable on Mother's Day and it wasn't as busy as I thought it to be.\n\nAtmosphere was classy and ritzy, which was to be expected of any of the restaurants around that area. Piano plays typical lounge music, which added to the classy ambiance. Service was excellent and told us right away the market prices of the crab and lobster. I liked that they actually have display platters of their stone crab claws, their dungness crab and their king crab legs. Right away I knew what I was going to pick for my order: the dungness crab (felt too guilty to order any lobster tails, otherwise I would have preferred lobster over crab any day!) \n\nMy wine was a Pinot Noir - Aquinas, Napa 2009. Fruity nose and taste of cherries, light body - perfect for sipping throughout the whole night while eating crab. My dad had a Stone IPA. The waiter was very knowledgeable about how the SD microbrewery scene really loves their IPA's, which I confirmed. \n\nAppetizers consisted of fresh oysters from British Columbia and salt and pepper calamari. Both appetizers were decent. The calamari was not too greasy, and I liked both dipping sauces. \n\nThe best part about the meal was the dishes my mom and I got. (My dad and brother got fish, but I was way too busy savoring my food to try any of theirs)\n\nSouth African Lobster Tail: My mom's order, twin lobster tails. I've done my research and knew this was the premier lobster tail, and a tasting confirmed it. It was small, but the texture was oh-so-soft, slightly sweet and fresh. Definitely one of the best lobster tails I've had\n\nLive Steamed Pacific Northwest Dungeness Crab: The best crab I've ever tasted. The crab was very meaty in both body and leg. Loved that they sliced some of the legs so that you can easily peel off the inner legs, but you had to crack the two big crab legs. I thought crab legs were good, but I actually loved the body - one of the softest crab meats I've ever tasted. Enjoyed every bite, even if the meat was hard to get to. Had to eat it in one sitting as I didn't think this would be good the next day. The only con was that I made a mess in my jacket, but I've heard the best crab is the messiest. \n\nI saw the waiters serving desserts, and when we asked for their dessert menu, we got to see all of their offerings. My dad and brother picked the carrot cake. All of us agreed it was super delicious. It was not too rich, and I liked that they used walnuts. One of the best carrot cakes I've had, and usually I'm not a fan of carrot cake.\n\nThe only con is that they only do validation on the valet parking and not in the hotel self-parking. I remember the restaurants used to do this, specifically the Melting Pot. \n\nDefinitely recommend this for the special occasions. Seafood is way too good to pass up.

As it was my first time at Pampas, we chose the Rodizio menu which allowed us full access to their side bar as well as an unlimited selection of meats. This is a fantastic place for a couple or for a group. Definitely expect to be there for a few hours.\n\nWhat makes this experience fun is the variety of salads, vegetables and other dishes at the side bar as well as the magic red/green \"button\".  We joked that it was the easy button... as soon as you flip the button over from red to green, carvers in green chef jackets come to your table nearly immediately procuring different meats on large skewers.  Until you flip that \"button\" back, they will continue to come.  For larger pieces of meat you'll put to use the small personal tongs to grab the top portion while the carver completes his cut.\n\n\nOur server came over and took our drink order. I thought I'd try out the Alma which resulted in an alcoholic smoothie. No, not thick - just reminiscent in taste. After this, I changed it up to a gin dirty martini.\n\nNext their \"bread\" arrived at the table consisting of crispy polenta, a cheesy roll/biscuit, and a fried panko crusted banana. \n\nAfter filling my plate at the side bar with baby spinach salad, red and yellow beets, julienned carrots and a banana vinaigrette, tabbouleh,  grilled peaches, sautteed button mushrooms, hearts of palm, Spanish olives, collard greens, balled watermelon with a hint of fresh mint, and mashed potatoes that I could've sworn were perfectly whipped with coconut milk; I returned to our table, flipped the \"button\" over and tried the Lombo (spicy pork tenderloin). As it was slow roasted, the juices and flavor was amazing. Next up was the Fraldinha (skirt steak with an onion herb marinade)... again aromatic and perfectly cooked.  That was quickly followed by the Sirloin filet with garlic and herbs, Tri-tip, and Presunto (black forest ham with grilled pineapple).  When the  Frango Picante (chicken legs marinated with garlic and spices) and Frango (chicken legs) came by.. I had to decline.  \n\nAre you kidding me, I would've LOVED to try it however did you read everything I ate? \n\nSo I found a skosh more room.  I had a double espresso and their chocolate torte with caramel ice cream (HEAVENLY) and a brazil nut toffee with bacon and smoked sea salt. See, I wouldn't have consumed any more... but bacon was mentioned. I'm a sucker for bacon.\n\nTurns out I chose well... the toffee was amazing, the caramel ice cream was stupendous.  The torte itself, meh - nothing to write home about, but the aforementioned made up for that. \n\nOur server, whose name escapes me at the moment! was fantastic; funny, confident and good looking. :)\n\n\nNeedless to say, I left absolutely satisfied.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ"}

I went with a friend the next evening without a reservation.  Probably not a good idea, especially since it was a Friday night, but the restaurant appeared half empty when we walked through the front doors.  All tables inside were reserved, but we were able to be seated immediately on the patio, which was fine by us.\n\nThe burger at Bocado is called the \"Bocado burger stack\" and it's hard not to compare it to the H&F burger because they are so similar.  Like the H&F burger, the Bocado burger is served with a side of fries and ketchup.  The Bocado burger is similar in size to the H&F burger and uses H&F buns.  However, the buns at Bocado have sesame seeds on them while the burger at H&F does not.  The Bocado burger is also $12 compared to H&F's $10.\n\nOK, enough with the comparisons.  The Bocado burger is a double patty burger with two slices of American cheese, housemade pickles, and a little bit of mayo.  The meat is made from short rib, beef brisket, and organic ground beef.  The cheese melts right into the bun and meat.  The burger is tasty, juicy, and almost melts in your mouth.  It's simply excellent and is indeed a worthy rival to H&F's burger, IMO.  Every bite is delicious.  Creative Loafing named Bocado's burger the best burger in Atlanta in 2010.\n\nI'd like to come back and try other items on their menu.  Their menu is just one page and you can tell they emphasize quality and focus on local ingredients.  The restaurant itself has been open for about a year and a half now.  It's not too large in size, but does feature a bar and, as mentioned above, an outdoor patio.  The interior design is modern and simple.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, although service was slow towards the end as business picked up.  The restaurant reached capacity by the time we left around 8pm.\n\nValet parking is available, although we just parked on 8th St. right next to the restaurant.  Unlike Holeman & Finch, this is more of a sit-down restaurant and not a pub, so reservations are recommended.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NhRYzLtnHbZivgUGjT8qFw"}

She didn't listen to how I wanted my hair, but the cut wasn't terrible. It looked fine, it was just not what I wanted and for almost $50 I wanted the exact thing I asked for. I would do research on which stylist to choose for your hair appointment. I've always had appointments with junior stylists, but I imagine senior stylists will work wonders on your hair.

The Brioche bun had an aoili of some sort on it and some greens. There was a slice of smoked bacon on there was well. The fries were done in duck fat, perfectly crisped and oozing with flavor.

It was a crap shoot. If the movie did great, you had customers coming from around the block and lining up. But since most movies these days are treated like flash in the pan material. Here today, gone before you can even make it to the theater the next week, the whole structure changed. \n\nIn comes the multiplex. The killer of these type of theaters. No longer limited to one film, you could show many at the same time. Spreading your odds on which ones will bring in the bacon and which ones will be great places to bring a date for some alone time in the dark.. \n\nMuch like communism, this theater looks great on paper. You have it in the middle of the westwood village here. An actual organic small nightlife. And you have people flocking to the fake city night life places like Universal City Walk and The Grove. Yeah, it's no wonder these places are a dying breed.\n\nOn the inside, I'm not going to lie, the place needs to be fixed up a little. The screen needs to either get bigger to actually make those side seats worth noting, and perhaps the whole place needs a good clean up. But the memories I've had here. Star Wars screenings, countless premieres.. I have so many fond memories of this place and to see it potentially go down over the years because time isn't on its side.. a tragedy. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go to a single theater movie house sometime in the future before you can no longer find them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BhHL2vthE_YdaiP6rElMwQ"}

I didn't expect it to be busy at all, so I guess the Minami people didn't either, because the service was terrible. There were only 2 waitresses and 2 chefs for the entire place, trying to accommodate a packed house with 2 very large parties. Ok, maybe I can understand this, but...\n\nThe waitress was very attentive for the first 5 minutes, before we even opened up our menu. There are 2 menus, and they are a visual pleasure, so it took us 10-15 minutes. By this time, the waitress had completely ignored the table. I had to raise my hand, and it was already around 7pm.\n\nThe food took over 1 hour to be served.  Yes we were checking our watches. And the hot food items were cold! I even saw other people's plates just sitting on the counter for over 15 minutes. We wondered if they were just on display, but they actually served this to other people. So I can't blame the chefs, although in addition the rolls were very sloppily cut...uneven pieces and some too big to fit in one bite. Decent taste though. When the waitress served a few plates, I asked her if the other plates were on the way, and she looked at me like she didn't know we had ordered more food. The other waitress had to bring them to us.\n\nWe finally finished at around 9pm. I can't believe the entire dining experience took 3 hours. I wouldn't have minded as much if at any time during the 1 hour wait, the waitress had come over and apologized for the wait and offered a free appetizer, anything to hold us over.\n\nThey were so strange, ignoring certain tables and quick (well, relatively quick) with others. I couldn't figure out the pattern. One table came after us, were brought their food before us, and left before us. I also overheard other tables complaining about the wait time, so we weren't the only ones.\n\nI will never go here again. And I don't care if they have great service any other day/time, a restaurant is only as good as the experience you had with them.

They have a lot of 'famous' dishes, such as the deep fried French toast, but since I prefer savory, I always go with an omelet. For $8.75, you get an omelet with 4 fillings (including cheese) which comes with toast. Their bread is homemade, and they offer white, wheat, or raisin (which is a $.75 upcharge, but worth it). The omelets do not come with potatoes, but if you're a lumberjack and can put it away, I recommend ordering the potatoes (which are cubed and grilled, not grated or sliced) with the added onions, peppers and cheese - really delicious. \n\nMy husband is more of a lunch person, so when we go he always orders the Rueben with a side of sweet potato fries.

If you are looking for anything beyond a chain experience (Biaggi's, Chili's, Panera, etc.) the few diamonds in the rough are hard to come by.\n\nCouple this with the fact that cupcakeries have sprung up across the country in the past few years like a blight, with little to no quality control or easy way to distinguish the good from the bad, and my concern about Cakes on Walnut was already piqued before even sampling their offerings. But that concern quickly evaporated after my first visit, and now Cakes is a must-stop for me, as I am expected to walk through the door in the city in which I reside with a box of the latest cupcakes from Champaign. \n\nCakes delivers on its name by offering eight varieties of cupcakes each day, ranging from the staple (vanilla; red velvet) to the exciting (smore; limoncello).  Contrary to what a couple of other reviewers have said, these cakes do _not_ taste like a mix, but taste and are homemade - you can watch the process go down in the open kitchen area, if you like.  The frosting is delectable, although you will have a hard time avoiding wiping a fair amount of it on your nose as you attempt to eat it.\n\nThe ambiance is nice and charming, hand-painted with a swallow motif on the wall and cute, modern interior.  The bar is a nice touch and great place to enjoy a cupcake with a glass of milk or French press coffee.  The staff are friendly and warm and don't mind if you nurse your single cupcake for awhile, or grab them to go.\n\nCakes on Walnut is one of the few truly special food destinations in C-U and one of the few whose reputation crosses the city limits.

We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!\n\nAs Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good.

I feel it is over-priced (tiny portion sizes and mediocre ingredients in many menu items.) However, I loved the cocktails prepared by Ms. Irwin at 67 Orange Street the night I went-a couple delicious Dark and Stormys and a terrific cucumber martini. \n\nThe space was quirky and warm (literally and figuratively.) One cheesey element was cheap \"Spin\" barstools bought from Crate and Barrel. They just didn't fit with the decor and were a less thoughtful element than the other aspects of the interior design.\n\nI met a friend, who also lives nearby, for a couple drinks on a Saturday night. The service was good, but the space was very tight (there was a private party downstairs that night.) I was forcefully bumped by the actual owner (who didn't apologize), as he walked by. The music was safe R n' B (Stevie Wonder, etc.) and was a smidge too loud for this small-ish space. However, the lighting was warm and inviting and the crowd was beautiful and pleasant.\n\nI did not eat at 67 Orange Street, but might do so soon. Three cocktails, two cranberrry juices, and a plate each of chips and popcorn set me back $55 without tip. Again, the drinks were delicious, but did not pack any real punch. Next time, I'll stop in for one drink, rather than stay for a second and third (and fourth.) A last-minute shot of Jameson's (was that supposed to be a double?) set me back $13.00-WOW! I had been stunned by $9.00 for the same in Tribeca, where I'm certain the overhead is considerably higher.\n\nOverall,  67 Orange Street is a nice place to impress a date in Harlem, but you'll need to find a spot that allows you to have a hassle-free conversation. Generally, if I want an upscale cocktail experience, I'd rather go to a place like Stone Rose, where I can imagine where my money is going.

Food is .44 cents per ounce, which is 2 cents less than over at whole foods, while they buy from the same providers, which makes their lettuce the best available.  I work at the greenhouse, and in all honesty, I have never seen a baked potato (which are in fact baked), come out to more than 2.75.  Their pre-made Specialty salads are a set price of 5.00, or 6.60 if you get an uber premium one.\n\nSomebody mentioned earlier that they were charged .05 for a container for the bread roll and soup.  This is because they already provide a to-go soup cup with lid and paper bag for free, and a wax roll holder.  All the containers are made from recycled paper, corn, or potato, are are very expensive to offer. \n\nLet's compare cost.  Cost-wise, we beat out other \"greasy food options\".  If you get equal amounts of hot food from The Greenhouse and Panda Express, (e.g. 1 lb {2-item combo} box from Panda, and 1 lb of Pasta Primavera from the Greenhouse), you will pay 4.64 from Greenhouse, while paying 6.64 at Panda for the same amount.  The Large salad is 5.00, the soda is 1.50, and that means your friend got a Baked Potato with toppings that weighed over 2.2 lbs, approximately 10.00.  Your friend just doesn't know how to portion themselves.

It's true. I'll do anything for a good slice of raw, fatty tuna that melts in my mouth. I've had a lot of sushi in my time...San Fran, Hawaii, and Tokyo top the list of best places. There were one or two in Chicago that were pretty good. Atlanta. Nothing. Zip. Zero. Atlanta has, as far as I know, not a single place that I'd rate above a 6 for quality of the sushi. I don't care about decor, or the scene, how pretty the roll looks, or how tight and low cut the servers dress it. When I get sushi, I want good fish, dammit. And Atlanta, you never deliver. I know nothing about Korean food, so, I'm just here to comment on the sushi.\n\nLook at the fish. Look at the color of the fish. Is the salmon deep orange and fatty, or pale and stringy? Is the tuna blood red or bright pink? Taste the fish. Feel the fish. Be one with the fish. The fish here is as good as any place ITP in Atlanta...although I'll admit that's not saying much. But if you want a nice, simple, clean piece of good sushi on the go, go here. The rolls here are simple, functional, and just a little on the hot side if you like them spicy, but light on the meat. The nigiri is a slightly bigger than average cut, simple, clean with a little lemon (not sure if I like that) with a quality a step up from the Atlanta average. I'd rate the salmon a 6.5, tuna a 6.5, and yellowtail a 6. Publix is on the scale of a 3. RuSan all you can eat, a -1. I'd rate the quality as slightly better than Zuma or MF. The ginger is quite hot. You get bonus miso too :) Its about as expensive as I expect sushi to be ($20 for three rolls, $13.50 for 3 orders of nigiri with 2pcs/order), and exactly worth the price...which is good for a land-locked sushi city. I'll come here when I have a little extra cash in my pocket.\n\nThey just opened. Hopefully they don't nerf the quality over time.

In addition to that, a reindeer that poops chocolate candies, a snowboarding Santa, gummies that look like full meals, gummies the glow in the dark, and bowls of \"Reindeer Food\" (cookies for kids).\n\nYup, I have 2 new BFFs now, aged 7 and 9.  To make things even more fun, I chose to distribute these gifts at the most optimal time - breakfast time on a school day!  Nothing like early morning hyperactivity!\n\nThe \"Chaos\" part of Ricky's is the station where you can make your own sundaes - what a dream.  I am sure they get packed during the summer months.\n\nGreat place to indulge a favorite child, or my personal favorite, your own inner child.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lbA1SINOq8a7qMbFplxg_A"}

I was planning on taking my three dogs in to get groomed because I wanted to support a mom/pop shop but I decided to Yelp first!! \n\nExcept for the last review, I have to agree with EVERYONE else above.  I never thought my first review was gonna be on a pet shop but I am an animal lover and wanted to share my experience as well.  So here it goes......\n\nA few weeks ago, while my husband ran into Vons for a few items and I was waiting in the car right outside the pet store, I could not help but notice all the loud dog cries coming out of Champion Pets.  As soon as my husband approached our vehicle, I asked if we could go inside to checkout the pet store and get some puppy love.  I love Dogs \n\nIt was a decent size store but it smelled funky (dirty) and it looked empty to me.  I'd say, lack of inventory.  \n\nWhen we walked in, two medium size dogs behind white picked fence/crates near the back entrance were just going crazy for our attention.  We started petting them and I Immediately noticed a big pile of poop in their crate.  I brought it to the workers attention that was behind the counter and he ordered someone else to clean up the mess.  All the dogs inside were barking and begging for attention.  One large dog was climbing over his crate (tall fences/gates) cause he wanted to get out.  As we went further in, I noticed more poop in another crate and told the guy cleaning the 1st poop that there was more poop here.  This dog was jumping up and down and was about to land in his own poop.  Oh, by the way, he was tied so if he managed to climb over this fence, the dog would choke to death by hanging himself.  \n\nThen I noticed the little dogs behind the windows.....\nMy heart melted and asked if I could play with one of them.  The guy behind the counter was kind enough to bring the cutest one out of his crate and let me play with this him inside the store.  I noticed more poop behind the windows and told the worker.  He went inside the room and started cleaning their little messes.  Most of the smaller dogs were living in these small spaces with their own feces.  It was really sad.  \n\nOn the window, they had a sign posted telling customers to let the front desk know if we see feces in their crates.  Seriously?  Why are they not doing their only job!!??  Is is that hard to make a habit of checking their beds/crates for feces every half hour or at least by the hour!!  \n\nWhile playing with the little puppy, I noticed the puppy had matted fur and did not look like he was cared for.  I wanted to cry and take him home but my husband did not think it was a good idea since we have three males at home.   \n\nAnyway, I appreciate everyone's honest review on here.  It's taken me a couple of years to finally find a place that is clean, professional and kind to our animals during their short visits.  They are a bit expensive but well worth it since they do an excellent job with grooming/shaving my three dogs evenly and have yet to send my furboos home stressed out!!  By the way, let me know if you are interested, they are not too far from \"Champion Pets\".\n\nI am just glad I did not take a chance and schedule an appointment without checking Yelp first.  Thank you YELP!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "f8UMl56pSzrLEVQLap5XWw"}

A faithful client was late (but did not know she was late) and instead of addressing the situation directly and asking if she could return another time or looking for another solution, the staff rushed her through their service with no explanation whatsoever.  When the client asked why she was being rushed, the technician told her that she had been instructed to \"give a minimal service.\"  Asked about this, the owner did not even apologize.\n\nI understand the importance of running a tight ship in the service industry -- other clients don't want to wait because someone else was late.  But to simply rush a late client by giving them crappy service -- without even speaking to them about the situation -- that's just bad customer service and it creates bad will.  In this case, the customer initially thought that the salon was overbooked and so she was being treated unprofessionally as a result. \n\nIt's good to give great service, but part of that is communicating with clients -- all the reviews for Nouvelle that are not good on Yelp seem to have that problem at their root.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GE2yJpX5msaNg9HZN_BF8Q"}

I've since tried some other high-end places on Newbury and the like, and have never received treatment that surpassed my experience here.  Sure it is pricey for a salon, but as far as good full-service spas go, the prices are reasonable.  The facials there are extremely relaxing and effective.  I never feel like my face is congested or goopy upon leaving, just soft and refreshed.  The products smell excellent.   The massages I had were very comfortable; heated table, just the right amount of music, good decor, and of course, skilled hands.  I've had several haircuts and colorings there by senior and junior stylists alike, and each has had a unique and effective style for my (sometimes pesky) wavy and thick hair (though I will say that if you don't have a preference, go with a junior stylist and save some cash).\n\nI think a nice thing about the vibe in Pyara is that it fits Harvard Square well.  Though it's a relatively nice spa, the receptionists, hairdressers and aestheticians all have an alternative and often punk-rock sensibility.  There is nothing stuffy about Pyara (or Aveda salons in general, it seems).  They are down to earth, no pun intended.  They are knowledgeable and will recommend products they've used on you at the end of your visit but it's not high pressure.\n\nThe only downside to Pyara is that it can be tough to get an appointment when you want one.  I think it's wonderful that they are opening another spa and salon in Burlington this fall, with extended services.  I'm sure it will get plenty of business if it's anything like Pyara Harvard Square.  Plus, finally, I'll be able to park my car and not fret during my relaxation time about feeding the meters.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kKheinNcdRiRcmVWaMbFqQ"}

Same menu (although they've added a veggie burger, turkey burger, and a few chicken sandos), same prices.  And they do it right.  Give me a greasy burger, with greasy fries (I'll take the steak fries extra crispy, thanks) and a shake (my preference is strawberry, but go for what you like... it's all about excess here).\n\nOh, and don't be a pussy health nut and get a Baby Fat... At least go for a Fatburger.  And if you're hungry, go for the Kingburger.  With cheese.  Add some bacon.  Hell, they'll even add an egg and chili if you want... did somebody say BREAKFAST???  Hell yes.\n\nSo I was torn on how to rate this place.  Do I give it 1 star because it's a dirty shithole of a restaurant that serves grease packaged as a burger?  I was close.  But no.  I'm giving this joint 4 stars, for being everything that you want when you're craving a nasty, greasy, deliciously fattening burger on the late night.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SPDKXBx7yC3lAOY4fkGN2A"}

I believe we were the last live act to play there before they closed. That's right. We CLOSED the Ballard Firehouse. He remembered us, which was pretty cool. I seem to remember he was a fan of Cheers. Who isn't. (See our video of cheers at the showbox for proof)\n\nThe stage is located right at the entrance, reducing the distance and potential hernia dramatically when carrying equipment in. It isn't huge, but it isn't tiny. Optimus Rhyme had at least 5 guys up there, including drum/bass/guitar so... ample space.\n\nTommy's location is prime. As many people came in to watch us who were just walking by at the time as there were fans. With the multitude of pool tables upstairs, there is an awesome built in crowd. I like that in a bar. It's rough playing an out-of-the-way place (or a dull place) with no built in crowd. Tommy's doesn't have either of those problems.\n\nBar is HUGE. Plenty of room to slide in and grab a drink. Dance/mosh area in front of the stage is also huge.\n\nAnd I seem to remember that the bathroom, though small, didn't stink too bad.

Ummm...if by \"flavored\" they mean, Mrs. Dash seasoning sprinkled on the crust, which don't get me wrong, is quite tasty. This is a new pizza location amongst seemingly hundreds on \"the drag\". Let's see...in an 8 block radius we've got Dominos, Pizza Hut, Austin's Pizza, Niki's, Pappa Johns, Conan's, Pizza Classics, Mellow Mushroom, blah blah....and NOW HUNGRY HOWIE'S! Does this place stand out amongst its competition? I will say a mellow, \"yes\". \n\nThe pizza itself isn't anything to rave on about, but the flavored crust is an exciting change.

My boyfriend has chatted up the owners who are more than happy to tell their patrons of their undying devotion to the Hungry Howie's franchise. Despite it being a chain, it certainly doesn't feel like it. I would so much rather kick it with Howie than Pappa John, Pizza Butt, or the cardboardy Domino's combined.\n\nAnother great thing is that when you order your food, the owners will open up the box and show you your food...like their proud of it.  I haven't  seen such beaming pride since my parents' faces at my brothers' band performances back in the mid-nineties. I mean, when they show me the food, what do they expect me to do? ha ha ha...\n\nA major bummer however, is the delivery charge. It's something like $3! Chances are, if you're ordering from HH, you live in walking distance. Unless you're stoned out of your mind, save money and don't get it delivered. Get off your ass, go to the store, chat up the friendly owners and see if they proudly open up the pizza box for your approval. After all, the pizza does come in cute little yellow and black taxi cab looking boxes. \n\nHungry Howie\nOh Hungry Howie\nSprinkle your tasty blend of spices upon my \nsoon-to-be- devoured-pizza crust\nI'll wash you down with some cinnamon sticks and a smile. \nNothing from Detroit ever left such a good taste in my mouth. \nSigh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LgU9jnnEbiZo99KXrFeJQw"}

In the countless times now that I've been here, I have actually only ever ordered the Combo 1 with the Pudgie Elvis pancakes (the combo itself is $8.50, plus $2 to substitute the world's most amazing pancakes for the, equally delicious I'm sure, buttermilk ones).  The combo includes two eggs, two sausage links or strips of bacon, breakfast potatoes, and two pancakes.  The eggs, sausage (which I usually order), and potatoes are all pretty standard diner fare...nothing special, but are perfectly prepared every time and hit the breakfast spot.  The Pudgie Elvis pancakes, however, are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  \n\nI'm a huge foodie and I have eaten my share of pancakes...I do not exaggerate when I say these are some of the best I've EVER had.  They are the perfect combination of sweet and a little savory (not so sugary that they leave that waxy feeling in the inside of my mouth, but enough so that they feel a little sinful to eat so early in the day).  They are fluffy, but not cakey.  The bananas are sliced and placed in perfect proportion on top as is the peanut butter sauce which is drizzled over the whole thing.  Positively delicious.  The orange juice and coffee are excellent as well.  Actually, the coffee is exceptional and comes with unlimited and frequent refills, always a plus.  I've sampled the BF's frequent selection, the DaKine French Toast (also fantastic), as well as the WTF?! Pancakes (yummy and definitely a different take on the traditional breakfast cake).\n\nConsidering how busy this place always seems to be, the service is outstanding!  My water and coffee are constantly being refilled, and it is with this same frequency that I am asked if I am enjoying my meal (always a \"yes\"!).  It is not the annoying, over eager kind of service that makes me feel like I need to scarf down my food and rush out of the place, rather it is sincere and welcoming.  Even when I have had to wait, it is never for too long, and from the second we are seated the service is prompt.  Inevitably, each time I visit I see the owner, Mark, on the floor helping the staff or greeting patrons.  Without fail he manages to make his way through each table to ask personally if we are enjoying the experience (again, always a \"yes\").\n\nThe decor is homey and inviting, with photos of dogs (some I presume to be the owner's) and area landmarks emblazoned on the wallpaper by the restrooms.  I've noticed some cool industrial elements as well...steel bleacher benches at some of the larger tables, tractor seats that serve as the chairs at the counter by the kitchen, and old license plates framing the mirrors in the restrooms.\n\nGiven the number of shitty and all too familiar fast-food chain restaurants along Figueroa, this place is a Godsend to the brunch crowd at USC, and heck to the foodies of LA!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BonZ748EKm8pwtVQalFpYQ"}

The broccoli was horribly overcooked and mushy. The soup was relatively thin, a refreshing positive compared to the cornstarchy stuff served at most places, but the flavor was a bit too sour and not hot at all. The next time I ordered one of their generic fried dishes with sweet sauce (maybe general Tso's or orange chicken). It was the typical Americanized Chinese fair. Way too sweet and not crispy enough, the chicken was a bit soggy.\n\nOne big plus though is that their takeout containers are very nice. So nice you could reuse them if you want.

Not Carnegie Deli, mind you, but pretty substantial. Somewhere along the way, economics took over.  They started to offer full (8 oz) and half orders (4 oz). In recent years, seems like the 1/2 order option became the full order norm. Just seems a bit skimpy. But I guess that's how you keep the sandwiches under $10.\n\nOn the plus side, the new generation of help is friendlier and more..well... helpful.  Back in the day, they'd scream at you, make fun of you to your face and hit on your girlfriend.  I never saw the charm in that.\n\nAnd in spite of my portion peeve, the freshness of the food, variety of selection and \"build your own\" options continue to bring me back.\n\nNow a word of advise.  \n\nGeoff's was not put on this earth to purvey veggie-sprout-hummus fare.  I know its healthy and I know its better for the cattle.  But its boring.  \n\nGeoff's \"raison d'etre\" is to provide the experience of piping hot bologna and melted Swiss cheese grease running down your forearms.

To get inside the lounge, you have to enter the Vortex, walk through the dining area and back into the restroom hallway.  At the end of that narrow hallway is where the entrance to the lounge is.  Strange, but that's how it works.\n\nI went to the Laughing Skull Lounge twice to watch a friend perform some of his first ever stand-up comedy routines.  Tuesday and Wednesday nights are \"Open Mic\" nights at the lounge.  Doors open at 7:45pm and shows start at 8pm or shortly thereafter.  Tickets are $10 each and the show lasts 2 to 2.5 hours.\n\nOpen Mic nights are nights when a bunch of comedians sign up and perform roughly 5-minute acts on stage.  Most of the comics are amateurs and are getting into stand-up for their first time.  If you attend an Open Mic night, more than likely you will see several comics' performing for their first time on stage.  Because of this, you may witness some poor souls bomb.\n\nThe nights I went, there were 13 to 15 comics plus the host.  The host was pretty good and interjected humor between each act.  Our crowds were lucky as almost all of the acts were funny, though there were definitely a few bombs and WTF acts.  Be prepared because anything goes.  There were plenty of vulgar and highly offensive jokes to go around.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the lounge is tiny.  The room seats only 74 and everyone is nestled closely together.  The front row, which I think may be reserved for \"VIPs\" only, has a few small tables to set your drinks on.  The other rows consist of small, neatly arranged wooden chairs.  The back of the room is where the bar is, as well as a few staggered benches.\n\nThere is a two drink minimum (loosely enforced) and the drinks are strong.  No food is served, so if you plan to eat, plan to grab your meal before or after the show.  The Vortex next door being the most obvious choice for pre or post-gaming.\n\nStreet parking and various pay lots and parking decks are located close to the club.  Laughing Skull recommends parking in the AmeriPark lot across the street, which costs $5.  It's the most convenient lot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VmgpUM8-fbwkSMbbwwiy6w"}

You wouldn't expect a restaurant in the YMCA building anywhere--or maybe I'm old school--but the Thai place in Princeton is so located (in the South Building). The restaurant--more cafe-ish--seats about 15 packed, and seats and table are pretty close so expect some elbow bumping: there's also a small patio that may seat ten peeps. You order at the counter and the troops bring the food to you--but don't expect table service after that: sorta on your own (as the placards asking you to bus your own table imply). Young troop who took our order was from the North, and I was able to converse minimally in Standard Thai while my wife threw in some Northern Dialect. He also chuckled when I spoke to him in Thai as I caught him by surprise. Parking is in the Y- private lot, though your only two blocks off Nassau to the West and an easy walk either via parking garage or street parking.\n\nNo Crab Rangoon, so we started with the Fresh Spring Rolls (4 x shrimp, $7.25). They were fresh undeniably--made to order versus earlier in the day--though the wrap didn't stay closed [stickiness didn't set in] and I made a bit of a mess, especially when dipping in the soy sauce (sweet, peanuts on the side)--shoulda been peanut sauce methinks. Pooh followed with the Tom Yum Noodle Soup ($6.25) which, while sufficiently large, was sorta bland and included broccoli and mushrooms as the veggies; the ground pork was OK, but the soup really needed some taste [either via broth enhancers or more herbs]. With no Pad Kee Mao to be had on the menu, I ordered off menu the same (beef, $6.95) and the Thai Dude said wouldn't be a problem (a spicy Pad Si-ew, in retrospect, would have been a better option). The noodles were of the Pad Thai variety (think), the sauce was essentially an enhanced soy rather than the standard thicker variety, the dish included egg, and it wasn't spicy. Yes it was a wok-prepared noodle dish, but it seemed a hybrid I couldn't place. No spice aside (second time in a while I had to ask for hot pepper), it only had marginal taste about the soy sauce. Also got my token Diet Coke from can (self-served); Pooh got a Thai Iced Tea ($2.95) and I was brought one for free [thanks] though I only sipped the milk out since I'm not a tea dude.\n\nGuys bathroom is in the other building though chicks walk down the hall. Also looks like they do catering, though it appeared there was also decent walk in traffic. On your own for grabbing silverware, napkins, chopsticks and non-Thai drinks and everything is within a 10-ft radius of most tables.

As a Pton student with a big sweet tooth, I used to be a huge Twist fan, at least until Fruity Yogurt (on Nassau beside CVS) came along.  \n\nFruity Yogurt wins hands down, and here's why:\n\nCOST:\nTwist is way too expensive, so I used to go less often for froyo but now that I've tried the lower prices at Fruity Yogurt, I get to satisfy my froyo cravings every week!! :) Ahhh I'm so happy haha.\n\nVARIETY:\n\nThere's something for everyone at Fruity Yogurt... it's like Twist but better, more types of fro-yo, more creative flavors, and more depth to the flavors too, and that's just talking about the frozen yogurt.  Honeydew, Coconut, Acai Berry, Tart (SO good, despite being a plain yogurt flavor!), Taro (I can't believe there's Taro in a place like Pton!), Cookies n' Cream, and more... and SO many toppings!\n\nThey also serve the best bubble teas I've had here on the East Coast... it's so hard to do well and I'm so impressed! Just try it and you'll know... it's hard to explain. \n\nTwist only has eight types of fro-yo, and I only like two of them consistently.  No smoothies or slushies or shaved ice desserts or bubble tea or regular teas.  Step it up, Twist!\n\nTASTE:\nThis is where Fruity Yogurt beats out Twist most of all, hands down.  Fruity Yogurt uses majority yogurt in its recipes, and it's milk-free in all but two flavors (Cookies n' Cream and Green Tea)... this is great and MUCH healthier than froyo that is majority milk-based.  Less preservatives and natural food coloring too! \n\nI used to be a big fan of Twist but now that I know what the flavors can be like in froyo, I'll never go back unless they change their recipes.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nAt Twist I've sometimes had the displeasure of having to sit near really loud and annoying high schoolers (I guess it's a popular place for them?!) and waiting in line behind these people makes me want to gauge my eyes out.  What's the point of being in a college town if I have to run into obnoxious high schoolers when I'm looking for a relaxing treat?\n\nI like the music at Fruity Yogurt more, and I've never had trouble finding a seat.  I like how Twist has board games and cool art on the walls, but it doesn't overcome the other cons for me.  It would help if Fruity Yogurt had bigger tables and board games, though, so people could hang out.  On the other hand, the majority of its business seems to be people who do takeout.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nFruity Yogurt wins hand down.  Twist stole the former cashier at Fruity Yogurt by offering her a manager position.  I saw her working at Twist after being at Fruity Yogurt as the cashier weeks earlier; and that was the last time I went to Twist (I used to go just for the Eurotart flavor).  I spoke to the manager at Fruity Yogurt and mentioned that cashier thing, and she confirmed it.  That's really lame, and one of the main reasons why I would refuse to go to Twist even if Fruity Yogurt somehow moved elsewhere.  \n\nMore importantly, the customer service at Fruity Yogurt is AWESOME.  Definitely the best... do befriend the manager and people who make the teas there... they are so much fun and my boyfriend and I ended up talking for twenty minutes with them.  What a pleasure!\n\nTHE VERDICT?\nSave your money and go to Fruity Yogurt for more froyo variety, better taste, more for your money, and greater dessert and beverage options!  \n\nCheck out my other reviews of places in and around Pton! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "xmAosRr4LAu-uU3J7lc7PA"}

The steak is better than Houstons, but I'd rather go to Madeleines or Ruths Chris at these prices.  The Newcastle beer comes straight from a bottle - cannot mess that one up.\n\nThe Bad - The Short Ribs Osso Bucco style looked way better than they were.  I was not enjoying any of this, except a few bites of the mashed potatoes and baby carrots.  It lacked flavor and what flavor it did have was gross (BTW - their steak sauce is also very yukkky!).\n\nThe crispy Ahi appetizer was also terrible.

My hygienist (Katie? I'm not sure what her name was) was AWESOME--funny, informative, honest. Walker Dental has digital x-rays, which may seem standard to some people but which was brand new to me! I was so happy to have had such an easy experience after all those years of horrible gag-inducing x-rays! Plus with the digital ones, you can see the results immediately and there's no risk (no lead apron needed, although she put it on because most patients ask for it out of habit!). They also have a spiffy 360 x-ray machine that shows your wisdom teeth, if you have any. The hygienist explained everything she was looking at in my x-rays in minute detail to me, which was both interesting and helpful. Like I said, getting my teeth cleaned was great, and the receptionist, Danielle, is FANTASTIC. She is so sweet and understanding!\n\nI gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of Dr. Walker himself. He's a nice guy and he's really chill, but I think perhaps he's a bit TOO chill and a bit presumptuous, in that he assumed I knew all kinds of things and made me go out of my way to ask questions (or, when I forgot, to Google things at home later)! I liked him at first, when he didn't recommend that I get my wisdom teeth taken out unless I absolutely needed to, which I don't. I liked that--no surgery for me unless it's 100% necessary, thank you! And I hate those dentists who just recommend it no matter what. He was nice and friendly enough, and I didn't think twice about it.\n\nBut my second visit was for a cavity filling. It was my FIRST ever cavity, so I was nervous as all get out and had no idea what to expect. He didn't tell me ANYthing preceding the appointment, and I had to call and email a number of times just to get him to tell me some basics, like what to expect if A happens or what to expect if B happens. Then, after the actual filling (which turned out to be painless), he didn't tell me if I could eat, drink, brush my teeth, etc. I had to look it up online to find out what kind of filling I'd gotten (I was able to figure out that I'd gotten a white composite filling because he used a blue light) and therefore to figure out what I was allowed to do!\n\nI would like to say, though, that during the actual filling, Dr. Walker was great. He told me step by step what he was doing, reassured me every few minutes because I was nervous, and seemed very sure of himself (which is a good thing when someone is drilling into your tooth!).\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience at Walker Dental. I would definitely recommend them, especially given the horror stories I've heard elsewhere. Be prepared to ask your own questions if you want information out of the dentist himself, but everything else about this place was great.\n\nAlso, as a side note, if you recommend a friend, they give you a $50 credit-- a nice bonus!

It was like the Pacific Ocean of checkered shirts.\n\nMaybe it's because Texas, by and large, has a strong contingent of cowboys and ranch hands. Obviously, that scene isn't as prevalent in Austin, but I can only imagine that if I were to hop on my Razor Scooter and kick/push 30-50 miles in any direction, I'd encounter some of these hard workin' Americans. Forgive me for stereotyping, but many cowboy types wear plaid... and that's my theory as to why Cream has so many varieties of my favorite button-up shirt. If you're a like-minded fashionisto and dig your plaid shirts as well, you've pretty much hit the jackpot here. \n\nIn addition to the shirts, they had a ton of great finds... ranging from knitted beanies to retro 60's polyester pants. In fact, I'm sporting a pair of brown Levi's from said generation right this moment, and they're quickly becoming my favorite pair of long shorts.\n\nThe store itself gets 4 stars out of me for their quality selection of threads and the fact that they have a seamstress on-site for custom alterations... but that fifth star comes courtesy of the unparalleled customer service I received. It was, very possibly, the best customer service I've ever experienced at a store of this nature.\n\nI was chatting with the woman behind the counter about how I was in town for a friend's wedding and that I was on the hunt for a nice pair of slacks.

She gave me some great suggestions, and ultimately, I decided on purchasing a pair of pants that she picked out. Upon checkout, she invited me to a party with free beer at their new location on South 1st. Because of the wedding, I couldn't make it... but it was a nice gesture nonetheless.\n\nFab selection of clothes (fab--so '60s), parking in the back and bangin' TLC from employee to customer.

Sushi place by Japanese owners. Nuff said. I'm not knocking on other non-japanese owned sushi bars, but somethings are better in the hands of the people who created it. \n\nCame here with the GF last Friday night after a last second ditch effort to go to NODA down the street, BEST decision I made all day. The wait was about 15mins, the tables were filled. but the line wasn't that excessive. \n\nHostess is a old Japanese obaasan who's (as agreed upon by GF & I)  too cute. Toooo Cute. Very friendly and very traditional with greeting, introduction and overall interaction. \n\nWaiter was friendly, prompt, and efficient. \n\nFOOD?? Well the food was simply AMAZING! \n\nChirashi with tempura: the fish was fresh and cut to perfection, not big nor small. The presentation is beautiful in a rectangular box and the tempura is nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The dipping sauce was a little bit on the bland side, but that's ok, the tempura itself was very tasty. \n\nThe quality of the fish is something else. judging by the pictures on the wall, they often feature freshly caught local fish (tuna, yellow tails, etc). \n\nOh and they had blue fin toro! $15 for 2 piece of sushi. Oh shit! I just shitted myself thinking about. Never have i tasted anything quite like it at any other sushi restaurant. The way the fish melts, the taste of clean fatty fish is simply amazing! simply exquisite! If you've never tired it, if you like buttery fish, try it!\n\nAlthough the Salmon sashimi was very delicious and buttery, GF claims she's had better else where. Hard to believe her. =). The portion is small. as in quantity wise. But with quality that high it's hard to dismiss their portion. The presentation again is very nice. Better then others. \n\nSeaweed salad is one of the best if not THE best we've had. Period. Very nice and mild, not overly masked by heavy loads of dressing (ponzu). Nice touch of sesame oil and a nice mix of different kinds of seaweed. Most use the string cut seaweed, but they add several variety that gives it a nice mix and palate pleaser. \n\nGF had their Philly Roll (wit cheese, duh). Normally I hate Philly rolls because I think it's a great way for a restaurant to use cheap cuts of fish and mask it with the overpowering taste of cream cheese. However, after much resistance, I was forced to swallow on and oh was it delicious. Still not a terrible fan of Philly rolls in general, but it was mighty tasty! \n\noh they also serve ORGANIC GREEN TEA!! Look, I know a thing or two about TEA, my family is a TEA, I come from a family of TEA and danggit they serve one hell of a cut of Ocha. Very smooth with no sappy after taste as you're accustomed to with other cheap/mixxed green tea. It really clears the palate so you may enjoy other exquisite bits of food. \n\nThis place is pricier then most other sushi places. But given the quality, service and overall delight of the place. I Love it! \n\nCheers, \n-Herbal Tea \n\nR.I.P - W.W. 108  =(", "type": "review", "business_id": "RiZqeuLN-3y04yh4c20Y0A"}

They used to be called India Palace Cuisine.  I don't know if management changed also, so the food I ate might not be representative of what it was previously.  In any case, I became aware of this restaurant because I received a menu of theirs in the mail with some tantalizing coupons.  They have a decent selection of dishes, but what surprised me were the prices.  Most dishes are between $7-10.  I thought this was suspicious because I'm used to Indian food costing at least 12 bucks.  With prices this low, something has to give, right?  Well as it turns out, the answer is yes and no.  My sister and I ordered Take-Out from here.  We ordered 2 garlic naan and 3 dinner entrees and the total cost was only 28 bucks (including tax).  The best choice was their  eggplant dish (Baingan Bhartha).  The spiciness was just right and flavors were absolutely delicious.  The next best thing we ordered was the Saag Paneer.  This dish was good, but not anything spectacular.  I wish they put more Paneer in it!  The disappointment came in the forum of their Shrimp Vindaloo.  The menu stated \"jumbo\" shrimp, but the shrimp were actually quite small and the sauce was too tomato-ey and thin.  I would not recommend this dish.  The garlic naans we got, however, were fluffy and tasty and chock full of garlic.  I can't say anything about the service since I didn't dine-in, but when we walked in to pick up our food the waiter was pleasant.

I'd say the only reason to go here is to hang out with a group of friends, but oftentimes when I've come, the music has been playing so loud (or the general atmosphere was so loud) I could only hear the people immediately next to me anyway.

Since I left Princeton, I have had a hard time finding a slice that even compares to the thousands of slices I've had at Pizza Star. I have arguments to this day with friends who are from different areas of Princeton about the best Pizza in town. You have those who say Victors was the best, others who claim Conte's makes the best pizza, but they pale in comparison. Pizza Star's Pizza, is a wide slice on thin crust. It passes the slice-fold-test that all slices should pass. Conte's is a small greasy slice. Aside from the nostalgia of the place, Conte's really lacks. Stop into Pizza Star and you will run into guys who have been there for over 30 years spinning dough and spreading sauce the way Pizza is supposed to be prepared. \n\nNow I'm all worked up, I may have to jump on the road and endure the 7 hour ride to Princeton to enjoy a real slice, plain, pepperoni or otherwise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fWZV4YEESe0XDcdyB53OHA"}

Affordable, fast, and good. The only problem? Erratic business hours. Mediterranean Caf\u00e9 is open Monday through Friday from 11 to 7, on Saturday from 11 to 3, and is closed on Sundays. It's obvious that this place has made a lot of money because dinner service is practically non-existent. And you know what? They fucking mean it when they say if you come within the last 40 minutes you can only order takeout. Luckily the wife and I made it in at 6:05 - although, eating while the workers are cleaning around you can be a bit off-putting. \n\nFor nOobs, the menu can be a little tricky. However, in general, the meat dishes such as the kebabs and chicken shawerma are served with meat on top of a bed of seasoned rice with sides of hummus, Greek salad, pita bread, garlic spread, and hot sauce. To be honest, I don't know what the rest of the menu is like because the wife and I tend to favor meat over rabbit food. \n\nRegardless, we have been trying to eat healthy, so we both ordered chicken dishes. She ordered the chicken kebab and I ordered the chicken shawerma. The chicken kebab plate is served with two skewers of chicken breast that are marinated with lemon, garlic, and various spices. I don't know if it had to do with the fact that we arrived during the last hour of business, but the chicken was really dry. While the chicken kebab was disappointing, the chicken shawerma was really tender and delicious. Once again, for the nOobs out there, shawerma is basically bits and pieces of sporadically sliced marinated chicken in garlic and spices. \n\nAside from the pita that tasted store bought and the lame Greek salad consisting of lettuce and a couple chunks of tomato with an olive oil based dressing, the complimentary sides and condiments that came with our food were pretty good. I really enjoyed the seasoned rice with noodle bits in it and the hummus tasted home-made. Also, their garlic spread was really flavorful and reminded me of the spread at Zankou Chicken. However, my favorite add-on was their surprisingly savory hot sauce. That shit made everything taste better. In fact, I ended up mixing it in with my rice, my hummus, and my chicken. \n\nIn addition to the sides that came with our dishes, we ordered a large tabbouleh and a tzatziki. The tabbouleh, which is basically chopped parsley, mint, bulgur, and seasoning was really fresh. And the tzatziki, which is a yogurt mixed with cucumbers and spices, was really cool and refreshing. \n\nAt the end of the day, Mediterranean Caf\u00e9 serves really good cuisine - that is when they are fucking open. And speaking of end of the day, my suggestion is not to come here at the end of the day. \n\n*Mediterranean Caf\u00e9 is definitely more of a lunch/takeout establishment than a full-on restaurant. \n\n**There is limited seating and when it gets busy it will get really claustrophobic. Oh yea, and if there is a line, good luck getting a refill.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Rz_EYBuygGYz-xCRZ7042g"}

I read the news. But I have been meaning to try Hungry Mother for quite some time now, and a visit from out-of-towner Dad was a great excuse for such a nice dinner! \n\nWhen first walking into Hungry Mother, I did not know it was going to be so small and quaint! (Thank God! Because my Dad hates fancy schmanzy Boston Restaurants) Nestled inside of an old house, the homey decor was cozy and inviting but chic, like I made reservations for a family dinner that was about to blow my mind. \n\nUpon sitting, I was immediately asked by our fabulous waiter, \"Describe to me the drink you would like to taste tonight in a few adjectives...\" Oh! I thought, this is going to be good! How many restaurants can make mean cocktails?! Not many. And to begin with a cocktail was the start of something very very special. \n\nAfter giving the words \"Bourbon\" and \"Smokey\" off he went to deliver the news to the bartender. When he came back, my cocktail was a type of twist on a classic Manhattan, topped with liquid smoke. It was one of the best drinks I've ever had. My friend (who came along) ordered the drink of the day which had something to do with Louisiana in the title. Hers was sweeter but still delicious. We we're both really happy with our personalized selections.\n\nWe all ordered lots of plates. Of course we tried the skillet corn bread that was magically topped with some kind of browned butter. Everyone who goes here has to try it, it's delicious! We also started with a little plate of slivered radishes with an herby, creme fraiche topping and the market vegetable that was roasted cauliflower baked with a cheesy top. Both were so good!\n\nOur main dish was the market fish that was baked in parchment with fresh vegetables (we ordered it for the kale!) and then performatively opened up on the table so that all of the steam oozed out in front of us while he topped it with a garlic butter sauce. Ohh dreamy!\n\nSince I've now hit about five paragraphs I'll stop the descriptions and end because I've probably beat a dead horse or many of you have stopped reading already. So to wrap it all up, Hungry Mother was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in Boston thus far. Both classic, cozy and delicious, I find myself very intrigued by their small, but seasonal menu wanting to bring friends for drinks and out-of-towners for dining. Also, I give it 5 stars because our waiter was quite a gem! He was so kind and thoughtful to even take a photo at the end of our meal for my jealous Mom back home! I would highly recommend Hungry Mother to anyone who wants a unique, but casual experience and supports local foods! Yum!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DfrvJL-6H5i1nsyL6H6VGg"}

To me, a good barbeque joint is not only about the meats but also the fixins and sides.\n\nThe Brunswick stew in particular was pathetic. Hands down the worst Brunswick stew I have ever tasted.

The area resembles the old shopping strip-meets-new shopping strip of San Luis Obispo.  What they did -- or so I've been told -- is that they've managed to preserve the old strip, leaving it looking the way it presumably did in the 70s.  Rhino Records is located in the older part.  The Back Abbey in the new part.  Both distinct areas of their aesthetic and consumer pull. \n\nThe Back Abbey specializes in Belgian draft beer.  They carry some German and English beer, as well.\n\nWow, the selection of beer. Let me tell you! A lof of them I have never heard of. I tasted the Augustijn (Belgian) and the Hofbrau Original (German).  Both were good, but I prefer the Hofbrau.They come in different sized glasses, with the Hofbrau coming in a long glass. The Augustijn was $9, and the Hofbrau $6. The Hofbrau came in the larger glass, so the Augustijn must be considered some premium brew for it to be in a smaller glass and come knocking down doors at a mighty $9.  \n\nI liked the overall aesthetics of the place. There is an up-close-and-personal feel to the bar. Along with the standard bar and barstools set-up, there's a long table that goes from one end of the bar to the other. People sit across from each other and, since the tables are not wide, you're not far at all from the person sitting in front of you. Like I wrote earlier, up close and personal is what this bar has going for it.\n\nThey have a food menu, as well. Above their draft selection of beer, they have a chalkboard placed high up with a list of what they serve. For those veggies among us, they even make a veggie burger.\n\nLastly, the patrons all seem to know each other. Maybe it's the small town mentality. But it's not exactly a backwards, hick town. It's very much modern in certain ways, and people just love to talk. Couple that with brew, and there's a lot of talk going on.\n\nI had a discussion with someone at the bar, who bartends at a bar not too far from The Back Abbey, and he told me that the Augustijn is the oldest beer recipe known to man. (Ah, ok. Old is vintage. Vintage is expensive. Thus, Augustijn is expensive.  And two + two = four. I got this down, partna'.)   Again, can we give it up for \"up close and personal\"?\n\nAnd, lastly, the bartenders were very attentive and enjoyed talking about the difference between the brews. The goateed gentlemen was specifically patient in describing which ones were Belgian, German, and English.\n\nThe mantra of this review should be \"up close and personal.\"  This is what this 4-star bar is all about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "81IjU5L-t-QQwsE38C63hQ"}

Thai Singha House does indeed have a section of their menu that reads vegetarian, but, unfortunately, their definition of vegetarian is different from mine.\n\nAll of the vegetarian curries, I was fortunately informed upon asking, do indeed contain fish sauce, which is an ingredient in the curry itself, and cannot be omitted.\n\nMy server suggested the pad thai as a fish-free vegetarian alternative, which I ordered, holding the egg. When it arrived, there appeared to be tofu in there and no egg, which was a good sign. But after a few blind, trusting bites I quickly realized that there was also chicken or pork mixed in as well. My server graciously took it back and honored my request for a house salad, of which I wasn't charged.\n\nI don't blame Thai Singha House for not understanding the definition of vegetarian (sadly, I know a few \"vegetarians\" who just don't eat red meat) although there are non-vegetarian Thai restaurants that get it and get it right, like Tamarind on South Street. \n\nSo, it's up to us as consumers to ask questions beforehand if we're not totally sure. And this is probably wise at any place where there is an ethnic and language barrier (On a related note, don't be fooled into thinking you can get vegan pho in Philly. It does not exist. You're eating beef broth or non-pho water broth, but not pho made with vegetable stock.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hnz1_h_D1eHSRtQqHSCZkw"}

I got a plate, and I was very pleased with the amount of meat I got.  However, what's the deal with only one pita?  I ran out of pita before I was halfway done with the lamb.  For something that costs so much less than the meat, why not toss another pita on there?  Pita was fine, very average.\n\nFor sides, I got the fries and the green beans (which come in a tomato sauce).  The green beans were too salty, and the fries not enough.  Fries were nice and crispy, but almost no flavor.  Beans were so-so, tasted like they were probably canned, but not bad.\n\nThis place is a good value, so definitely wins points there - plate was just over $7 with tax, and a good amount of food, plus a beverage.  I'm sure this is mostly because it is one of the newest places in PC, but the line was significantly longer/slower than the other places, which makes it tough on your lunch break, so keep in mind if time is an issue.\n\nOverall, two thumbs up on the meat (+2 stars), and a good value (+1 star), which makes it above average for PC offerings, but that standard is already low, unfortunately.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BKI9lC-Mn2W7TtjEInsaLA"}

I loved the service, everyone was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive. \n\nSo if you're looking for something different, a little off the beaten path of traditional Brazilian restaurants and you like  to have cheese with your wine before your meal like I do, then I would check this place out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ"}

I wouldn't say it was particularly good - it was exactly something I could have whipped up at home. My real gripe is that the guy didn't ask me if I wanted my toast buttered. I expected just some toasted bread that I would put jam on or something. But, out comes two slices of overly buttered toast; it was practically a butter sandwich.\n\nI guess that's my real problem with the place. It's set up like a diner but it doesn't have the diner atmosphere. A diner is supposed to be friendly and chatty but the employees didn't talk when I entered, ordered, or waited. It's also supposed to be bustling but the place, which is pretty small to start with, was practically empty at lunch hour. It was a diner without the appeal of one.

My eventual overall dissatisfaction arose from multiple cases of what started off as relatively minor problems.\n\nIn each case, what I thought of as relatively minor problems, grew into unresolvable beasts, when I had a need to contact CUSTOMER SERVICE (and I use that term very loosely). I don't know that they still do so, but I learned to cringe when they answered the phone with, \"How may I provide you with excellent service?\". It got to the point that my standard opening response was, \"I'll accept decent service\". \n\nWithout going further into details, I haven't had business with them for over 3 years now, that said... they have come back, uninvited, into my life.\n\nMy credit monitoring service recently contacted me with a notice of unusual activity. Investigating, I discovered that a collection company out of Florida had placed an unpaid bill of $33 on my credit report. There were no details but digging deeper, I went to http://annualcreditreport.com/ and found that it was associated with an AT&T claim.\n\nAs much as I dislike AT&T, I ALWAYS pay my bills (assuming I'm aware of them). I'm still investigating, but, this is just another check box confirming to NEVER again consider purchasing ANY service from AT&T.\n\nTheir sales people will say all the right things. Their brochures are shiny and refined. Their commercials are alluring. Their actual services and products are.... okay... but when something goes awry, and sooner or later something will... their customer service is substandard, significantly so, and is the basis for AVOIDING this company at all cost.

I'm not a fan of cream cheese appetizers so this was good, but not my favorite.  I did like the heat of the jalapenos though.  SHI-SO HOT; tempura fried shisho leaf topped with spicy tuna and a drizzling of eel sauce.  This was GREAT.  I was slightly disappointed that the shiso didn't add much flavor but the crisp worked wonderfully in holding up the tuna, which matched very well with the sweet sauce.  GYOZAS are great - handmade with a light loose veggie filling.  \n\nBoyfriend ordered the HAMBURG steak, three thin patties of ground beef with a pan fried crisp bottom and slathered with a homemade ketchup.  It comes with a side of cabbage slaw, potato salad and a wedge of cantaloupe.  Boyfriend liked the potato salad, which had cucumber slices inside. \n\nI ordered the MATSURI CHIRASHI, which came loaded with julienned daikon, furikaka sprinkled over the rice, and a selection of fishes - 3 tuna, 2 tamago, 1 salmon, a pile of ikura,  clam, eel, mackerel and I forget the rest.  \n\nFriend ordered the SPICY TUNA SALAD, which he enjoyed.  \n\nThe cooked entrees are all very reasonably priced at under $15 .

Nevertheless I will provide information on that.\n\nI learned about Dr. Tobinick via a Youtube video his office uploaded.  I made an appointment for a free consultation; his office is in the UCLA medical plaza  They had me first watch a video detailing his unique procedure which, he claims, will eliminate pain associated with a herniated disc (in about 70% of patients).\n\nI have a herniated disc in my neck.  The pain is much less than it was a year ago, but still I have pain every day and so I'd like to have my condition corrected.  I only take Aleve or aspirin on \"bad days.\"  I didn't see Dr. Tobinick but rather one of his associate MD's - Dr. Reyzin.  The staff said Dr. Tobinick was in Florida.\n\nAnyway, Dr. Reyzin said I was a candidate for this procedure.  The next step would be to schedule a complete examination and physical test - cost $300.00.  The procedure then costs $3,000.00 - $5,000.00.  That's a lot for a 10 minute procedure but if it works it would be worth it.  I have health insurance and I'll have to see if they'll cover this.\n\nI came home and tried to find some negative (or positive) info about Dr. Tobinick on the web; I couldn't find much of either.  I'll keep searching.  I'll update this review if I decide to have this procedure done.  My gut feeling tells me something is not right with regard to Dr. Tobinick's claims.  If 70% of patients had their pain eliminated, wouldn't every spine doctor be performing this procedure?  Or perhaps, maybe the procedure works but after several months to a year, the pain comes back (which is typically what happens when steroids are injected into a herniated disc).", "type": "review", "business_id": "FXpHCkccct8SJjN9r1BvPw"}

I don't know why, but people really make a big deal about this place. Best Thai food in Seattle? Maybe if all the more spacious and comfortable ones in the area are somehow inferior. That's not to say this place is anything short of excellent, or that I doubt in its ability to stand up to the competition. The food here is simply outstanding. Whether it's a better Thai restaurant than all the other ones in town is another question, but what is certain is that you really can't go wrong with any money spent here.\n\nBecause I knew how popular this place is and how limited the seating would be, I anticipated it getting full shortly after opening. I stood outside and waited until 11:30 AM with a handful of other eager customers. By 11:35, nearly every seat was taken. It was then that I realized I was dealing with serious business. While I was lucky enough to be seated, I saw the waiter turn away a few people and ask them to come back later because there just wasn't enough space to accomodate them. I don't know whether to be impressed by that, but if they're so successful, I wonder why they can't afford to get a bigger place.\n\nThe place itself, if the other reviews haven't made it obvious by now, is constantly busy and crowded. It looks old, worn out, and generally unpleasant. But it's a restaurant and not a museum where you marvel at artwork. The air here is pretty much always thick with the smell of delicious fried food. The kitchen isn't in its own separate room way in the back and out of the public eye; the cooks make your food right in front of your eyes. Consequently, it can also get rather hot, especially if you sit by the fires. But all this food is definitely worth the trouble. No matter how long you have to wait, you can be entertained by the aroma of other customers' meals and the display of the food being made.\n\nSince so much of the fun of eating here comes from watching the cooks make everything, I'd suggest getting one of the seats at the counter near the front of the restaurant, kind of in the corner. It's a spectacular display, although not as ostentatious as teppanyaki. The cooks' hands move with astounding speed. They'll grab from the ingredients around them, crack eggs single-handedly, and noisily clatter the woks around as they perform all their cooking in a seemingly effortless manner. It's nice being able to see exactly how all this food is prepared, especially if it's obvious that it's being done by people who clearly have a lot of experience.\n\nThe menu here is something of an oddity. Instead of the usual thin and light paper menus, the ones here appear to be entirely painted on wooden planks. My first instinct was actually to take it as a joke, but I realize that it may have been a stylistic choice. I suppose they're really going for that authentic Thai feel here. From the rather brief list of hardly more than thirty items, I ordered the Phad Thai for $7.50. This restaurant is supposedly top-tier, but I wanted to get the most basic dish before venturing onward to their more \"specialized\" delicacies. I got it with chicken and three stars on the spicy scale from one to five.\n\nAlthough there was quite a long queue of customers who had already placed their orders before I could get a chance to, it's almost not a concern because it was such a delight watching the guy cooking the meals jump from making one person's dish to another. It's amazing how he never seemed to mess up, too. On numerous occasions, it looked like he was stirring the food too carelessly and would make a mess, but he always seemed to catch it in his wok. The show had an almost mesmerizing quality to it. I don't know why I get such a kick out of watching one person multitask so efficiently. It's an entirely missed opportunity if you get seated at one of the tables to the side, away from where all the action is taking place. For this reason, I would not recommend coming here with too large and cumbersome of a group. Either way, it's quite possible to get seated right next to a complete stranger here.\n\nMy much-awaited lunch arrived with the chicken Phad Thai on one side of a long bowl, a clump of white rice occupying the other side, and a wedge of lime adjacent to all this. Sizzling in front of me, it looked and smelled like quite a feast, although I couldn't help but notice that it was... disappointingly small. To be fair, it was a very inexpensive dish, but insufficient as a whole meal for a voracious eater like me. All petty complaints, because the food itself was without a doubt among the best of Thai cuisine I've ever experienced. A sweet taste was dominant with this Phad Thai; I guess they had skimped on the spiciness, but I won't hold it against them. I may have exaggerated the flaws, but they're all insignificant when you consider that this is just about as close to perfection for Thai food in Seattle to feasibly reach.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw"}

I'm a huge fan of The Back Abbey's burgers, but the service and wait are always brutal, so I was really hoping that Eureka would win me over.\n\nAfter finishing my dry, medium-well (I asked for medium-rare) \"Italian Caprese Burger\" that was heavy on the bun and light on the flavor, I decided that The Back Abbey is definitely worth the longer wait AND the more expensive check. I would only return to Eureka if The Back Abbey had an hour+ wait, or if I just wanted a beer sans burger (the bar seemed pretty chill).\n\nSo why did I give Eureka 3 stars instead of 2 or 1? The service was great. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and she gave me an awesome beer recommendation (I had a \"White Rascal,\" which tasted like a more delicious Hoegaarden). She also hooked us up with the delicious truffle sauce stuff for our fries that came with the burgers for only $2 instead of making us order the $7.50 \"Eureka Truffle Fries\" appetizer. The restaurant has several big-screen TVs, which is much better than The Back Abbey's one small TV at the bar if you want to watch a game. They also had some pleasant, mellow live music. The burgers were roughly $9-10, which is about $2-3 less than the burgers at The Back Abbey, and they came with fries, whereas The Back Abbey's burgers do not. My beer was $5, which is way cheaper than the average beer at The Back Abbey (this price difference is not surprising though since \"White Rascal\" is from an American brewery).\n\nBasically, I was hoping that Eureka would be The Back Abbey plus a hostess and a larger waitstaff, but their burgers just weren't up to snuff. I would potentially go back to enjoy a \"White Rascal\" on their awesome outdoor patio, but when it comes to burgers, I'm still Team Back Abbey all the way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TFxcmjVIsW5bdW7rilHHpQ"}

I normally like a strong garlic taste, however the garlic on the bruschette was more of a mild nutty garlic flavor but still so tasty! The tomato&basil bruschette was typical and nothing too special. The caprese salad was also very good, had fresh mozzarella and pesto.  Then we got our scallops and cauliflower, and I know everyone raves about the scallop, but the scallops were just good, not extraordinary. On the other hand, the cauliflower was AMAZING! I don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but if everyone made cauliflower like this, kids wouldn't have any problems eating their veggies! We got our bacaro burgers, with the egg of course, and it was a unique way to eat a burger, but unique in a good way. By the end of all our small plates, we were incredibly stuffed.

I'm a regular here, and for a good reason. Many good reasons actually. \n\nOne of its best qualities is how late they serve food until - Midnight every night. And their late night menu is not your usual bar fare. Everything from great munchies in the appetizer section to full salads, burgers, and veggie lasagna. Of course you can also score the Fries for the Boys, Nachos, Quesadilla, et al.\n\nThey have live music Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Sometimes Sunday and Monday too. My favorite nights are Thursday for the great jazz bands and Sundays when they feature a solo pianist. Food in front, beer in hand... Nothin' better.\n\nThe food is amazing - gourmet quality and an excellent selection. Especially for someone who leans toward vegetarian, but they don't discriminate. Some of my favorites include:\n-The Breakfast Burrito, a more-than-hearty package of potato, eggs, and cheese. Comes with salsa. Perfect for a Saturday morning with a Bloody Mary, or any other time of any other day (it's on the late night menu!). I usually add avocado. Classic.\n-The Dijon Chicken, creamy, savory completely satisfying. Sub the chicken for tofu if that's your thing.\n-The Veggie Burger. Or the Eggplant Burger. Or any burger really. So good. \n-The Taco Salad. It's hearty, it's pretty healthy, and it's so so good.\n-The desserts! Bread Pudding, Vegan Chocolate Cake, Mocha Torte especially. Ask for some of Dr. Bob's ice cream on the side! Expletive, that is incredible.\n\nDrink selection is pretty killer too. They have monthly special martinis, but I usually go for their great beer selection.\n-Dale Bros beer! Not only is it local to Upland, but the beer is so good! I've made many converts to their brews, from the classic Pomona Queen to their special brews like the incredible California Black Beer.\n-Chimay White, and cheaper than it is at The Back Abbey a few blocks down.\n-Wine Wednesday. Speaks for itself.\n\nObviously I love the place, and am friendly with much of the staff. But I'm trying to write an honest, helpful review. I hope that comes across.\n\nI'm sad to see that some people have had some bad experiences, especially Mister X (I don't totally agree with all of Molly Z's review, if they run out of stuff it's because they purchase local, they're not a \"wine restaurant\" they are a restaurant, they don't have tablecloths at the bar tables, etc. - none of that is unreasonable). There's no denying that they had some bad experiences though.\n\nAnd that's a shame. The place is a rare combo of excellent food, drink, and culture. I hope those reviewers can take some solace in that the restaurant takes those critiques and any other comments they get very seriously, and work to improve the place and their service, as any good restaurant should. So some good comes out of that. Shame it had to go down this way.\n\nIt's worth seeing for your self. It really is.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ekd4p4JmygAgzoaR4jFMJQ"}

As upset as I was, I was also thrilled that it would finally be open. Except that Monday, when I drove over, it was closed again. WTF?!?\n\nThey finally opened on Wednesday, so Ben and I made plans to have lunch there on Friday. My enthusiasm was dampened a bit by Jenny's review, but I saw on Chowhound that you could get kimchi if you asked and that the spicy chicken was pretty tasty.\n\nBen ordered the bulgogi and I ordered the spicy chicken. You get to pick two panchan dishes; we both got the spicy cucumbers but I ordered the sesame broccoli and Ben ordered the Asian potato salad. I liked the spicy cucumbers more than he did, but then again, my mom doesn't make these for me on request. The potato salad had onions in it, so I didn't try it, but Ben said it was just okay. The sesame broccoli was extremely bland and the stalks were somehow...flaccid. Ugh.\n\nThe spicy chicken was decent, though not that spicy; the flavor profile was pretty good but it just needed a little extra oomph. The bulgogi was underspiced and a little fatty. Oh, we did get kimchi, though ODDLY ENOUGH, they asked Ben if he wanted it and not me. I was insulted; I could be Asian, too! I have totally passed for Filipina before. Anyhow, I ran back to the cashier and asked to have some added to my order. It was not bad, though a little extra-fermenty to my tastebuds. Ben said it tasted like it came from a jar.\n\nOn the bright side, the place is really nicely decorated and they serve Diet Coke.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EAYBdA_ZWXcHmH9rYtIdHg"}

With such a grand sign in those great two colors, I had to give it a try before I completely moved out of town. When a 4-star average on Yelp, I had pretty high expectations going in.\n\nUnfortunately, these expectations were not met, and my overall dining experience was mediocre. I got a Georgia Reuben, a sandwich I have enjoyed many times from Zingerman's and Dimo's.\n\nFor the same price, at Dimo's I can get a sandwich that's twice as big and frankly twice as good. I wonder if the high average of M&B is due to the fact many of the students reviewing it have never ventured out to Stadium. I'm amazed by how many people here are raving about the size of the sandwiches...I peaked at the couple next to me and there's were also the same size as mine...while they pack in a decent amount of meat, I wasn't even completely full and needed to grab a slice of pizza a few hours later. Dimo's has never failed to completely fill me up (you get chips in addition to a pickle there). Zingerman's Georgia Reuben or Tom's New Job, while far more expensive so perhaps not a fair comparison, are still far superior sandwichs.\n\nUltimately a lot of this comes down to ingredients. Both Dimo's and Zingerman's use their own bread...while Dimo's bread isn't world-renowned like Zingerman's, its still huge and guaranteed always since they make it themselves. M&B's bread was mediocre bread-aisle bread. Meh. For a Georgia Reuben, having crisp bread is key.\n\nI didn't feel the other ingredients blended that well together. While the turkey wasn't by any means bad, it lacked its own taste...it just felt bland. The cheese wasn't well melted and the Russian dressing sauce was lacking. It mainly felt like I was using bread to eat a lot of turkey with my hands. For the price I paid, I was expecting a more holistic sandwich experience.\n\nThe place itself is nice enough; its small, with the menu taking up an entire wall and a TV in the corner. Props to them for offering so many types of sandwiches. The service was fine--they bring the sandwich to you which is a nice touch.\n\nI would appreciate it if the sandwiches were larger, ingredients (esp bread) were better, sandwiches were warmed/cooked more, and came with chips. That's a lot to ask for. Would I return? Probably not. There are too many other great options on South U to pass up, and if I want a sandwich, I'll head over to Dimo's or Zingerman's.\n\nGo blue though!", "type": "review", "business_id": "GqqBWV8ysYB48_jLPMl2bA"}

Of course I said that's fine. I mean, I always put my hair up and on her card it said master stylist....hmmm. \n\nAnyway, she washed my hair and did some trimming. While she is cutting my hair she tell me about this procedure that would make my hair straight and really awesome, how much you say? $$450 bucks$$ How long does it last? 2-3 months!! \n\nWhen she finished doing her thing, she started to blow dry my hair, and then told me that she could do it half way or all the way dry, but my hair would be fluffy. OF COURSE...you guessed it! I opted for half way. She dried it for what seemed like than 5 min. At my other place it takes at least 2 people 7-10minutes to completely dry my hair, that's the magnitude of fierceness people! I digress... \n\nShe put some spray of product in my hair and showed me the mirror. It looked like my hair was more pufffy and frizzy than when I came in. She told me I shouldn't put my hair in a ponytail..Ok you're the master lady. She gave me her card and a print out of the expensive ass procedure she mentioned. I paid and tipped her and was on my way. I know I should have said something. But I'd expect them to know hair more than I would. \n\nThe worst part was walking to baby Gap which is almost next door to the salon. I caught a glimpse of my hair in the mirror, and I looked like some kinda crazy! I could not put my hair back up in a ponytail any faster!!! I tell you guys, NO STYLISTS SHOULD HAVE LET THEIR CLIENT WALK OUT OF THEIR CHAIR LIKE THAT! If you want proof or a laugh just ask me for the pic I took not 5 minutes later at Gap. I'll gladly provide it to you. HORRIBLE. I wanted to cry. TEARS!! \n\nSeems like a very big hit or miss here from the reviews I read. However, I will not be back...ever!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2MJzSgwVK_IgqJ9y3XpaKQ"}

Eh, that doesn't always work out well... The place had much recommendation, therefore I had the thought to order something basic to size up the place.  Since this was mainly a steakhouse, I decided to go with the steak and fries dinner - too boring for my usual fare.\n\nThough boring sounding, that was only until the food arrived.  The steak came out amazing, and the fries that came in a metal cup (and stayed hot throughout) were some of the best I've ever had.  The meal was full of flavor and the taste seemed to linger on for days.  The lady also raved about her delicious looking perfect seared scallops and asparagus dish.\n\nWe topped it off with an equally delicious bananas foster, another boring sounding dessert done right (while enviously watching the two businessmen eat their cool looking sorbets).\n\nComing back shortly after for lunch with our out of town guests, I sprung for the 21 day dry aged Delmonico steak ($37).  Seasoned and salted perfectly, this must have been the best steak I had in the last few years.  Tasting their Filet Mignon side by side, this fattier special cut was a couple more times more flavorful.\n\nTry the steak.

It was a pumpkin soup with pumpkin seeds on top and pumpkin crispy things.  While good, not worth $10.  The dish was very shallow, and I really don't think any soup is worth $10.  My mom had the salmon with couscous which was around $16.  She thought it was good, but lacking in flavor.\nThe problem I had with Upstairs, besides being overpriced, was I felt I didn't belong.  It was a Monday afternoon, but I felt under dressed (it was cold, I had a puffy vest on ok), and out of place.  The guys sitting directly behind me were obvious intellectuals who have to talk just loud enough so everyone can hear their conversation and know how smart they are.  Also, someone, who I believe to be the manager/owner was walking around to several tables talking to them about their meals (which I find a bit odd for lunch?) and completely skipped over our table, even after catching my eye.

I ordered the D5 beef, the lowest tier of beef on the menu. The thinking was as a direct comparison to Shabu-Zen - their lowest-quality beef is quite good. Shabu Square's beef offering was $1 cheaper, but for the quality, it should have been a bit less. A very unappealing cut of meat, chewy when cooked, and with little flavor. \nThe noodles were fatter than I've had elsewhere, which was a plus, and the vegetable plate was quite nice, missing only some tofu options.\nThe dessert was a thai custard, which was served with two pieces of white bread. Wonder Bread, rather. A very unappealing presentation, but the custard was quite delicious.\n\nThe service, Im happy to say, was excellent - I never felt like people were hovering over, waiting to refill my water every time I took a sip, and I also was never put out for want of service. \n\nIn all, I think you'd do better with the higher-end offerings. The service was quite good, but the decor was a bit off (posters of alaskan tundra and caribbean beaches? errrrrr...). \n\nIn all, decent if you're craving shabu, but don't skimp on what you order.

I came here with my friend Sam N. and my other friend Patrick M. I ordered Shumai, which did not come until 1.5 hours later - with no apology, no nothing. An hour and a half later... FOR SHUMAI. This was supposed to be an appetizer! This was supposed to come out before my sushi! I was sad and hungry. Also, Sam N.'s Baked Lobster was cold in the middle and her portions were so small.  Our waitress, never checked in on us (which is also why my appetizer took too long) and we were sitting right behind the hostess' table. -_-' Not to mention, it took forever to get our check and leave. My best friend is a sushi waitress and I can understand the restaurant is busy, but it doesn't excuse the lack of amiability or attention to our table.\n\nThis is really not okay. \nThe reason why I gave Yamato's 1 star instead of 0 was because of Jesse, my last waiter, who really made an awesome impression on our table and gave us the extra attention I never see at this restaurant. I sincerely wish that service was replicated at every single order of Yamato.\n\nDaryl W. has made an awesome point: word of mouth is a powerful tool and I have already seen Jill T.'s review on facebook with MY fraternity brothers and my friends talking about it. \n\nPeace out, Yamato.\nAfter the piss poor service and mediocre sushi, I'm out of here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eqFRLwj2_0v_1y2y8Ur3cg"}

My fiance was OK with that, since they needed to be done soon or later. It wasn't any problem until we got the truck back. It stalled 3 times in the middle of W Holcombe (before the Kirby intersection). It was an EXTREMELY scary situation because this could have caused an accident as other cars will run into his truck. Luckily speaking, he was able to pull over to a strip center immediately. We were able to drive back to the shop, and when we confronted the manager, he was like there should be NO PROBLEM!!! He let his mechanics (whoever worked on the truck) to look into it again. We waited for another 30 minutes, and according to the manager's explanation, he said that it was NO PROBLEM at all because they tested drive it again and it never stalled. Plus he believed that the computer in the truck was set in the re-training mode (WTF, they must have done something, hello, although my fiance and I were no mechanics, but we aren't stupid). Wasn't it their job in the first place to ensure that everything was fine before letting us picking the truck up??????? Without a doubt, all they care about was the MONEY, and they didn't give a crap about our safety. FYI, this was our first visit, and it will be our last as well.
